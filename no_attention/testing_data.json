        "text": " Women's rights activists pledged Sunday to launch a wave of protests across Afghanistan if the Taliban fail to reopen girls' secondary schools within a week.Thousands of secondary school girls had flocked to classes on Wednesday after the hardline Islamists reopened their institutions for the first time since seizing power last August.But officials ordered the schools shut again just hours into the day, triggering international outrage.\"We call on the leaders of the Islamic Emirate to open girls' schools within one week,\" activist Halima Nasari read from a statement issued by four women's rights groups at a press conference in Kabul.\"If the girls' schools remain closed even after one week, we will open them ourselves and stage demonstrations throughout the country until our demands are met.\"The Taliban should be building more schools for girls in rural areas rather than shutting existing facilities, said the statement, which comes after several women's activists were detained in recent months.\"The people can no longer tolerate such oppression. We do not accept any excuse from the authorities,\" it said.On Saturday, about two dozen schoolgirls and women staged a protest in Kabul demanding the reopening of the schools.\"Women, teachers and girls should come out on the streets and protest,\" said student Zarghuna Ibrahimi, 16, who attended the press conference.\"The international community should support us.\"The education ministry has so far not given a clear reason for its policy reversal, but senior Taliban leader Suhail Shaheel told AFP that some \"practical issues\" were still to be resolved before reopening the schools.Since storming back to power the Taliban have rolled back two decades of gains made by Afghanistan's women, who have been squeezed out of many government jobs, barred from travelling alone, and ordered to dress according to a strict interpretation of the Koran.The Taliban had promised a softer version of the harsh Islamist rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001.But many restrictions have still crept back, often implemented locally at the whim of regional officials.Some Afghan women initially resisted the curbs, holding small protests where they demanded the right to education and work.But the Taliban soon rounded up the ringleaders, holding them incommunicado while denying that they had been detained.Since their release, most have gone silent.On Sunday, the Ministry for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ordered that men and women should not visit parks in Kabul on the same days.Women are now permitted to visit parks on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, while the remaining days were reserved for men, a ministry notification said.\"It is not the Islamic Emirate's order but our God's order that men and women who are strangers to each other should not gather at one place,\" Mohammad Yahya Aref, an official at the ministry, told AFP.\"This way women will be able to enjoy their time and freedom. No man will be there to trouble them,\" he said, adding that religious police were already implementing the order."

Much is at stake.\u201dIran has been engaged in efforts to revive the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia directly, and the United States indirectly since April 2021.Mr. Mora, who coordinates indirect talks between Iran and the U.S., arrived in Tehran late Saturday and on Sunday met Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, state news agency IRNA reported.The report gave no details on the meeting or earlier discussions between Mora and Iran\u2019s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri.\u201cBagheri stressed that an agreement can be reached if the American side is realistic,\u201d IRNA said.Mr. Mora\u2019s visit comes as EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell voiced hope for a renewed accord within \u201cdays\u201d.\u201cWe are very close but there are still some issues pending,\u201d Mr. Borrell told reporters on the sidelines of the Doha Forum in Qatar. \u201cI cannot tell you when or how, but it is a matter of days.\u201d The 2015 deal gave Iran much-needed sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme that would guarantee it could not develop a nuclear weapon \u2014 something it has always denied wanting to do. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday met top Israeli officials in Jerusalem to build consensus. Israel fiercely opposed the initial accord, which promised Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, and has said that a revived agreement will not do enough to curb the Iranian threat. Speaking alongside his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid, Mr. Blinken said the U.S. believes restoring the agreement was \u201cthe best way to put Iran\u2019s programme back in the box\u201d after the U.S. withdrew from the deal under former President Donald Trump in 2018."

        "text": "Chinese coast guard ships maneuvered dangerously close to Philippine coast guard ships at least four times near a disputed shoal over the past year, in moves that increased the risk of collision and violated international safety regulations, the Philippine government said Sunday.It was not immediately clear if the Philippines has formally protested the aggressive actions by the Chinese ships, but Manila's coast guard said the incidents would not deter it from deploying patrol vessels at Scarborough Shoal and in other areas within the country's internationally recognized exclusive economic zone.China seized Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing area about 200 kilometers (120 miles) off the northwestern coast of the Philippines and 600 kilometers (370 miles) southeast of China, after a tense naval standoff in 2012. Chinese coast guards ships then surrounded the shoal and restricted Filipino fishermen's access.The U.S. has accused China of bullying smaller South China Sea claimants like the Philippines and has deployed Navy ships and aircraft to promote freedom of navigation and overflight in the region. China, which claims the South China Sea virtually in totality, has warned Washington to stay away and accused it of meddling in what it says is a purely Asian dispute.The incidents were reported to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila and an inter-agency body on the South China Sea \u201cto address this issue through rules-based and peaceful approaches,\u201d Philippine coast guard chief Adm. Artemio Abu said in a statement.Earlier this month, a Chinese coast guard ship maneuvered just 21 yards (63 feet) from a Philippine patrol vessel and restricted its maneuvering space in the vicinity of Scarborough Shoal, the Philippine coast guard said, adding that the Chinese action was \u201ca clear violation\u201d of a 1972 international safety regulation that aims to prevent sea collisions.In June last year, two Chinese coast guard ships on two successive days moved dangerously close to two Philippine coast guard ships, which were participating in a maritime exercise off Scarborough Shoal. A month before, a Chinese coast guard ship moved close to a Philippine Bureau of Fisheries vessel manned by coast guard personnel also near the shoal, according to the coast guard.There was no immediate comment from the Chinese Embassy in Manila.China's seizure of Scarborough Shoal prompted the Philippines to bring the disputes to international arbitration. In 2016, a U.N.-backed tribunal invalidated most of China's claims and said it has violated the rights of Filipinos to fish at the shoal.China dismissed the ruling as a sham and continues to defy it but allowed Filipino fishermen to return to the shoal under Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who nurtured closer ties with Beijing after taking office in 2016. Despite cozier relations, however, sporadic territorial spats have persisted.Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also lay claims to the busy waterway through which an estimated $5 trillion in global trade passes each year.\u201cWe are fully aware of dangerous situations at sea, but these will not stop our deployment of assets and personnel\u201d to serve Filipino fishermen, Abu said. \u201cAs long as they feel safe seeing us during their fishing operations, we know that we are doing our job well.\u201d "

        "text": " Myanmar's leader vowed Sunday to intensify action against homegrown militia groups fighting the military-run government, saying the armed forces would \u201cannihilate\u201d them. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, speaking at a military parade marking Armed Forces Day, also urged ethnic minorities not to support groups opposed to army rule and ruled out negotiations with them. The military seized power last year from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Security forces used lethal force to suppress mass nationwide protests, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,700 civilians, according to a detailed tally compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.Forced to turn away from peaceful protests, many of those opposed to military rule took up arms, forming hundreds of militia groups called People\u2019s Defense Forces \u2014 better known as PDFs. In some parts of the country, they've joined forces with well-organized, battle-hardened ethnic armed groups, which have been fighting for greater autonomy for decades. Min Aung Hlaing, addressing thousands of military personnel during the parade in the capital Naypyitaw, said he would not negotiate with \u201cterrorist groups and their supporters for killing innocent people\u201d and threatening peace and security. He said the military \u2014 known as the Tatmadaw \u2014 \u201cwill annihilate them to (the) end,\u201d according to an official translation of his speech.His government has declared major resistance organizations \u2014 regardless of whether they are directly engaged in armed struggle \u2014 as terrorist groups. Membership or even contact with them carries harsh punishment under law.\u201cI would like to highlight that there are no governments or armies worldwide that negotiate with any terrorist groups,\u201d he said.Despite a huge advantage in equipment and numbers, Myanmar's military has struggled to crush the new militia units. Outgunned and outmanned, the PDFs have relied on support from local communities and knowledge of the terrain to carry out often surprisingly effective attacks on convoys, patrols, guard posts, police stations and isolated bases in remote areas.The military is currently conducting operations in Sagaing, in upper central Myanmar, and in Kayah State, in the country's east, using airstrikes, artillery barrages and the burning of villages. The army recently seems to have expanded its offensive into Chin State in the west and Kayin State in the southeast as well.Last year\u2019s Armed Forces Day was the single bloodiest since the military\u2019s Feb. 1, 2021, seizure of power. Security forces across the country opened fire on demonstrators, killing as many as 160 people.Anti-military protests were held Sunday despite the risks in Yangon, the country\u2019s biggest city, and elsewhere. To avoid arrest or injury, urban street protests usually involve flash mobs, which quickly disperse before security forces crack down.The main opposition group, the self-styled National Unity Government, urged people to join a \u201cPower Strike\u201d Sunday night by switching off the lights and their televisions for 30 minutes while the military parade is broadcast on state-run TV channels. The group said the strike also is intended to protest daily power outages. The blackouts started several months ago, and the government blames them on high gas prices and damage to power lines caused by sabotage.The United States, the European Union and 20 other countries issued a statement marking Armed Forces Day by recalling \u201cthose killed and displaced by violence over the last year, including at least 100 people killed on this day alone one year ago.\u201dIt called on the military to cease its violence and return to democratic rule, and urged countries not to supply arms to Myanmar.The U.S., Britain and Canada on Saturday imposed the latest in a series of coordinated sanctions on senior military officials and business leaders who allegedly act as arms dealers for Myanmar\u2019s army.The new measures targeted three senior military officers including the newly appointed chief of the air force and four alleged arms dealers as well as the companies linked to them. Washington also imposed sanctions on the army\u2019s 66th Light Infantry Division, which was accused of burning at least 30 civilians in their cars in Kayah State on Christmas Eve last year.The fresh sanctions came the same week that the U.S announced it had determined the military\u2019s actions in a crackdown on the Rohingya Muslim ethnic group in 2017 constituted genocide. A brutal counterinsurgency campaign compelled more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee from western Myanmar to Bangladesh, where virtually all remain. The atrocities committed by the army against the Rohingya have been well documented by U.N. investigators, and the World Court is considering a charge of genocide against the Tatmadaw."

        "text": " The free trade agreement between India and the UAE is likely to come into effect from May 1 this year, under which domestic exporters of as many as 6,090 goods from sectors like textiles, agriculture, dry fruits, gem and jewellery would get duty-free access to the UAE market, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said on Sunday. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) was signed by India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in February which aims to boost bilateral trade to $100 billion in the next five years from current $60 billion. The minister said that the detailed text of the pact has been released in public domain and now \u201cwe are trying to complete all our paperwork, all the customs notifications expeditiously. We hope it can be operationalised by May 1, 2022\u201d. Overall, the UAE is offering duty elimination on over 97% of its products which account for 99% of Indian exports here in value terms. Immediate duty-free access covers all labour-intensive sectors such as gems and jewellery, textiles and apparel, agricultural and fish products, leather, footwear, and sport goods, Pharmaceuticals and Medical devices, and many engineering products. \"Currently, we are exporting about $26 billion worth of goods to the UAE , almost 90% of them will get total tariff (or customs duty) elimination on Day 1 itself. Going forward in the next 5-7 or ten years, the rest of the 9.5% (about 1,270 goods) will also get zero duty,\" Mr. Goyal said at the Dubai Expo here. Explaining the importance of the pact, he said the UAE also opened doors for the rest of the Middle East, some parts of Africa and Europe. \u201cThis opens up huge opportunities for Indian businesses,\u201d he said adding the pact also opens doors to several service sectors which will expand job opportunities for Indian young boys and girls. Key areas of India's interest are computer related services, audio visual, education, health, tourism, travel, professionals services like nursing, engineering, and accountancy. \u201cWe are also working for mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) of professionals and skilled services, so that if they approve our nursing colleges then the nursing degree from that college will get automatic recognition here and vice versa,\u201d he said. On the other hand, India has offered significant concessions on goods of export interest to the UAE and that include dates, petroleum products (crude, LPG, Naptha), petrochemicals (polyethylene, polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride), metals (aluminium, copper, nickel, iron and steel), minerals (limestone, cement). India will be giving duty-free access to 7,694 goods on the day of implementation of the agreement. Around 2,400 goods would get zero duty in 5-10 years time period. As part of protective measures in the pact, there are stringent rules of origin criteria that reflect the requirement for substantial processing of up to 40% for most of the products and wholly obtained criteria for agricultural products. When asked about free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Mr. Goyal said: \u201cwe are at an advanced stage of discussion on the scope of the agreement. I believe that discussions will get over in the next 15-20 days\u201d. After that, he said, \u201cwe hope to launch formal negotiations for a broad based FTA with all the GCC nations and that will open up the entire Middle East market for Indian goods and services\u201d. Mr. Goyal, who will participate in the India-UAE Business Forum meet on March 29, said the aim of the meeting is to expand business to business engagements between the countries. The meeting is expected to be attended by businesses including Anish Shah from Mahindra and Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv CMD Sanjiv Bajaj, Vedanta Resources Chairman Anil Agarwal, ITC CMD Sanjiv Puri, Apollo Hospitals Joint MD Sangita Reddy, Bharti Airtel Joint MD Rajan Mittal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd Chairman Satish Reddy, and Byju's cofounder Byju Raveendran.

About 20 startups are expected to participate in this meet and that include Ritesh Agarwal from OyoRooms, Deepinder Goyal from Zomato, Nishant Pitti from EaseMyTrip, Prashant Prakash from Accel Ventures, and Vineet Rai from Aavishkaar Group. Talking about the India pavilion here at Dubai Expo 2020, Mr. Goyal said that it would be a permanent structure here. \u201cIndia has been given the honour along with the UAE and Saudi Arabia , and Morocco\u2026We will continue to get the chance to use that (India Pavilion) area to act as a facilitator or little bit of India in UAE,\u201d he added.

Pakistan has been on the edge since Opposition parties on March 8 submitted the no-confidence motion before the National Assembly Secretariat, alleging that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government led by Mr. Khan was responsible for the economic crisis and the spiralling inflation in the country.Two special trains have been mobilised by the national transporter, Pakistan Railways, from Lahore and Islamabad at the request of the government to transport its workers. Thousands of supporters of the Prime Minister are coming in trains, public vehicles and private cars to attend the \u201chistoric\u201d rally of the ruling party. The PTI caravan coming from Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and other cities will reach the Parade Ground here to attend the rally under the theme of \u2018Amr Bil Maroof\u2019 (enjoin the good). \u201cThe public meeting will be the largest in the history of the country and have a great impact,\u201d Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood told reporters on Saturday. The call for the rally was given by prime minister Khan as he has been trying to present his fight against a \u201cgroup of crooked opposition leaders\u201d, but still many believe that gathering could be his swan song due to the odds of no-confidence heavily decked against him. Separately, an equally-charged political event will be held in Islamabad on Monday by the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an alliance of the Opposition parties. The PDM comprising the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) retaliated to hold their power show a day later that will coincide with the National Assembly session when the no-confidence motion is set to be formally moved in the house. The JUI-F supporters have started moving under the supervision of local leaders, JUI-F spokesperson Aslam Ghauri told the media. They are mainly coming from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan where the party has a lot of support. Some of them have already reached Hakla Interchange near Islamabad. Another big protest march led by PML-N vice presidents Maryam Nawaz and her cousin Hamza Shehbaz, who is the son of Shehbaz Sharif, started from Lahore on Saturday. Travelling on the historic GT Road, they are scheduled to reach Islamabad on Monday to attend the opposition rally. \u201cIt (the march) will be the last nail in the coffin of the PTI government,\u201d Ms. Maryam told her supporters. Interior minister Sheikh Rashid warned that the Opposition would not be allowed to block any main roads for political activities as it was against the direction of the Supreme Court. \u201cWe have deployed paramilitary Rangers and Frontier Corps along the Srinagar Highway and any effort to block it will be resisted,\u201d he said.Mr. Rashid said that more than 15,000 security personnel would be deployed for keeping law and order and also warned to call the Army in case of any untoward incident. The political temperature has been slowly reaching a boiling point in the wake of the no-trust move by the Opposition on March 8. The make and break point for prime minister Khan is likely to be reached by the end of next week. The Opposition parties are confident that they can get the support of 172 members in the house of 342 to dislodge the government, while the government claims that it enjoys the required support in the house to foil the attempt.Mr. Khan came to power in 2018 with promises to create a \u2018Naya Pakistan\u2019 but miserably failed to address the basic problem of keeping the prices of commodities in control, giving air to the sails of opposition ships to make war on his government. With major allies of Mr. Khan looking the other way and about two dozen PTI members of parliament revolting against him, and the powerful establishment not providing a helping hand, he is less likely to get the support of the much-coveted 172 lawmakers. Mr. Khan, 69, is heading a coalition government and he can be removed if some of the partners decide to switch sides. He is facing a rebellion by his about two dozen lawmakers and allied parties which are also reluctant to pledge support to him. Both Mr. Khan and his ministers are trying to give the impression that everything was fine and he would come out victorious out of the trial. The PTI has 155 members in the 342-member National Assembly and needs at least 172 lawmakers on its side to remain in the government. "

The International Atomic Energy Agency has said the nuclear material in the facility is always subcritical and the inventory of radioactive material is very low, reducing the risks of radiation release.On the western side of the country, Russian rockets struck Lviv on Saturday while President Joe Biden visited neighboring Poland, serving as a reminder that Moscow is willing to strike anywhere in Ukraine despite its claim to be focusing its offensive on the country\u2019s east. Early Sunday, a chemical smell still lingered in the air as firefighters in Lviv sprayed water on a burned section of an oil facility hit in the Russian attack. A security guard at the site, Yaroslav Prokopiv, said he saw three rockets strike and destroy two oil tanks but no one was hurt. \u201cThe third strike threw me to the ground,\u201d he said.Russia's back-to-back airstrikes shook the city that has become a haven for an estimated 200,000 people who have had to flee their hometowns. Lviv had been largely spared since the invasion began, although missiles struck an aircraft repair facility near the main airport a week ago.In the dim, crowded bomb shelter under an apartment block a short ways from the first blast site, Olana Ukrainets, a 34-year-old IT professional, said she couldn\u2019t believe she had to hide again after fleeing from the northeastern city of Kharkiv, one of the most bombarded cities of the war.\u201cWe were on one side of the street and saw it on the other side,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw fire. I said to my friend, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 Then we heard the sound of an explosion and glass breaking. We tried to hide between buildings. I don\u2019t know what the target was.\u201dTwo cities on opposite ends of the country are seeing some of the worst suffering at the moment, Chernihiv in the north \u2014 strategically located on the road from the Belarusian border to the capital, Kyiv \u2014 and Mariupol in the south, a key port city on the Sea of Azov. Both are encircled by Russian forces, but still holding out. Chernihiv has been under attack since the early days of the invasion and over the last week, Russia destroyed the main vehicular bridge leading out of the city and rendered a nearby pedestrian bridge impassable, cutting off the last route for civilians to flee, or for food and medicine to be brought in.Chernihiv\u2019s remaining residents are terrified that each blast, bomb and body that lies uncollected on the streets ensnares them in the same macabre trap of unescapable killings and destruction.\u201cIn basements at night, everyone is talking about one thing: Chernihiv becoming (the) next Mariupol,\u201d said 38-year-old resident Ihar Kazmerchak, a linguistics scholar. He spoke to  The Associated Press by cellphone, amid incessant beeps signaling that his battery was dying. The city is without power, running water and heating. At pharmacies, the list of medicines no longer available grows longer by the day.Kazmerchak starts his day in long lines for drinking water, rationed to 10 liters (2 1/2 gallons) per person. People come with empty bottles and buckets for filling when water-delivery trucks make their rounds.\"Food is running out, and shelling and bombing doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d he said.More than half of the city's 280,000 inhabitants have already fled and hundreds who stayed have been killed, Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko said. Russian forces have bombed residential areas from low altitude in \u201cabsolutely clear weather\" and \"are deliberately destroying civilian infrastructure: schools, kindergartens, churches, residential buildings and even the local football stadium,\u201d Atroshenko told Ukrainian television.Refugees from Chernihiv who fled the encirclement and reached Poland this week spoke of broad and terrible destruction, with bombs flattening at least two schools in the city center and strikes also hitting the stadium, museums and many homes. They said that with utilities knocked out, people are taking water from the Desna to drink and that strikes are killing people while they wait in line for food. Volodymyr Fedorovych, 77, said he narrowly escaped a bomb that fell on a bread line he had been standing in just moments earlier. He said the blast killed 16 people and injured dozens, blowing off arms and legs. So intense is the siege that some of those trapped cannot even muster the strength to be afraid anymore, Kazmerchak said. \u201cRavaged houses, fires, corpses in the street, huge aircraft bombs that didn\u2019t explode in courtyards are not surprising anyone anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are simply tired of being scared and don\u2019t even always go down to the basements.\u201dBritain\u2019s defense ministry said Saturday that it doesn't expect a reprieve for citizens of Ukraine's bombarded cities anytime soon.\u201cRussia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties,\u201d the U.K. ministry said.Previous bombings of hospitals and other nonmilitary sites, including a theater in Mariupol where Ukrainian authorities said a Russian airstrike is believed to have killed 300 people last week, already have given rise to war crimes allegations. The invasion has driven more than 10 million people from their homes, almost a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s population. Of those, more than 3.7 million have fled the country entirely, according to the United Nations. Thousands of civilians are believed to have died."

We do not accept any excuse from the authorities,\" it said.On Saturday, about two dozen schoolgirls and women staged a protest in Kabul demanding the reopening of the schools.\"Women, teachers and girls should come out on the streets and protest,\" said student Zarghuna Ibrahimi, 16, who attended the press conference.\"The international community should support us.\"The education ministry has so far not given a clear reason for its policy reversal, but senior Taliban leader Suhail Shaheel told AFP that some \"practical issues\" were still to be resolved before reopening the schools.Since storming back to power the Taliban have rolled back two decades of gains made by Afghanistan's women, who have been squeezed out of many government jobs, barred from travelling alone, and ordered to dress according to a strict interpretation of the Koran.The Taliban had promised a softer version of the harsh Islamist rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001.But many restrictions have still crept back, often implemented locally at the whim of regional officials.Some Afghan women initially resisted the curbs, holding small protests where they demanded the right to education and work.But the Taliban soon rounded up the ringleaders, holding them incommunicado while denying that they had been detained.Since their release, most have gone silent.On Sunday, the Ministry for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ordered that men and women should not visit parks in Kabul on the same days.Women are now permitted to visit parks on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, while the remaining days were reserved for men, a ministry notification said.\"It is not the Islamic Emirate's order but our God's order that men and women who are strangers to each other should not gather at one place,\" Mohammad Yahya Aref, an official at the ministry, told AFP.\"This way women will be able to enjoy their time and freedom. No man will be there to trouble them,\" he said, adding that religious police were already implementing the order."

        "text": "Chinese coast guard ships maneuvered dangerously close to Philippine coast guard ships at least four times near a disputed shoal over the past year, in moves that increased the risk of collision and violated international safety regulations, the Philippine government said Sunday.It was not immediately clear if the Philippines has formally protested the aggressive actions by the Chinese ships, but Manila's coast guard said the incidents would not deter it from deploying patrol vessels at Scarborough Shoal and in other areas within the country's internationally recognized exclusive economic zone.China seized Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing area about 200 kilometers (120 miles) off the northwestern coast of the Philippines and 600 kilometers (370 miles) southeast of China, after a tense naval standoff in 2012. Chinese coast guards ships then surrounded the shoal and restricted Filipino fishermen's access.The U.S. has accused China of bullying smaller South China Sea claimants like the Philippines and has deployed Navy ships and aircraft to promote freedom of navigation and overflight in the region. China, which claims the South China Sea virtually in totality, has warned Washington to stay away and accused it of meddling in what it says is a purely Asian dispute.The incidents were reported to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila and an inter-agency body on the South China Sea \u201cto address this issue through rules-based and peaceful approaches,\u201d Philippine coast guard chief Adm. Artemio Abu said in a statement.Earlier this month, a Chinese coast guard ship maneuvered just 21 yards (63 feet) from a Philippine patrol vessel and restricted its maneuvering space in the vicinity of Scarborough Shoal, the Philippine coast guard said, adding that the Chinese action was \u201ca clear violation\u201d of a 1972 international safety regulation that aims to prevent sea collisions.In June last year, two Chinese coast guard ships on two successive days moved dangerously close to two Philippine coast guard ships, which were participating in a maritime exercise off Scarborough Shoal. A month before, a Chinese coast guard ship moved close to a Philippine Bureau of Fisheries vessel manned by coast guard personnel also near the shoal, according to the coast guard.There was no immediate comment from the Chinese Embassy in Manila.China's seizure of Scarborough Shoal prompted the Philippines to bring the disputes to international arbitration. In 2016, a U.N.-backed tribunal invalidated most of China's claims and said it has violated the rights of Filipinos to fish at the shoal.China dismissed the ruling as a sham and continues to defy it but allowed Filipino fishermen to return to the shoal under Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who nurtured closer ties with Beijing after taking office in 2016. Despite cozier relations, however, sporadic territorial spats have persisted.Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also lay claims to the busy waterway through which an estimated $5 trillion in global trade passes each year.\u201cWe are fully aware of dangerous situations at sea, but these will not stop our deployment of assets and personnel\u201d to serve Filipino fishermen, Abu said. \u201cAs long as they feel safe seeing us during their fishing operations, we know that we are doing our job well.\u201d "

        "text": " Myanmar's leader vowed Sunday to intensify action against homegrown militia groups fighting the military-run government, saying the armed forces would \u201cannihilate\u201d them. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, speaking at a military parade marking Armed Forces Day, also urged ethnic minorities not to support groups opposed to army rule and ruled out negotiations with them. The military seized power last year from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Security forces used lethal force to suppress mass nationwide protests, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,700 civilians, according to a detailed tally compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.Forced to turn away from peaceful protests, many of those opposed to military rule took up arms, forming hundreds of militia groups called People\u2019s Defense Forces \u2014 better known as PDFs. In some parts of the country, they've joined forces with well-organized, battle-hardened ethnic armed groups, which have been fighting for greater autonomy for decades. Min Aung Hlaing, addressing thousands of military personnel during the parade in the capital Naypyitaw, said he would not negotiate with \u201cterrorist groups and their supporters for killing innocent people\u201d and threatening peace and security. He said the military \u2014 known as the Tatmadaw \u2014 \u201cwill annihilate them to (the) end,\u201d according to an official translation of his speech.His government has declared major resistance organizations \u2014 regardless of whether they are directly engaged in armed struggle \u2014 as terrorist groups. Membership or even contact with them carries harsh punishment under law.\u201cI would like to highlight that there are no governments or armies worldwide that negotiate with any terrorist groups,\u201d he said.Despite a huge advantage in equipment and numbers, Myanmar's military has struggled to crush the new militia units. Outgunned and outmanned, the PDFs have relied on support from local communities and knowledge of the terrain to carry out often surprisingly effective attacks on convoys, patrols, guard posts, police stations and isolated bases in remote areas.The military is currently conducting operations in Sagaing, in upper central Myanmar, and in Kayah State, in the country's east, using airstrikes, artillery barrages and the burning of villages. The army recently seems to have expanded its offensive into Chin State in the west and Kayin State in the southeast as well.Last year\u2019s Armed Forces Day was the single bloodiest since the military\u2019s Feb. 1, 2021, seizure of power. Security forces across the country opened fire on demonstrators, killing as many as 160 people.Anti-military protests were held Sunday despite the risks in Yangon, the country\u2019s biggest city, and elsewhere. To avoid arrest or injury, urban street protests usually involve flash mobs, which quickly disperse before security forces crack down.The main opposition group, the self-styled National Unity Government, urged people to join a \u201cPower Strike\u201d Sunday night by switching off the lights and their televisions for 30 minutes while the military parade is broadcast on state-run TV channels. The group said the strike also is intended to protest daily power outages. The blackouts started several months ago, and the government blames them on high gas prices and damage to power lines caused by sabotage.The United States, the European Union and 20 other countries issued a statement marking Armed Forces Day by recalling \u201cthose killed and displaced by violence over the last year, including at least 100 people killed on this day alone one year ago.\u201dIt called on the military to cease its violence and return to democratic rule, and urged countries not to supply arms to Myanmar.The U.S., Britain and Canada on Saturday imposed the latest in a series of coordinated sanctions on senior military officials and business leaders who allegedly act as arms dealers for Myanmar\u2019s army.The new measures targeted three senior military officers including the newly appointed chief of the air force and four alleged arms dealers as well as the companies linked to them. Washington also imposed sanctions on the army\u2019s 66th Light Infantry Division, which was accused of burning at least 30 civilians in their cars in Kayah State on Christmas Eve last year.The fresh sanctions came the same week that the U.S announced it had determined the military\u2019s actions in a crackdown on the Rohingya Muslim ethnic group in 2017 constituted genocide. A brutal counterinsurgency campaign compelled more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee from western Myanmar to Bangladesh, where virtually all remain. The atrocities committed by the army against the Rohingya have been well documented by U.N. investigators, and the World Court is considering a charge of genocide against the Tatmadaw."

The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) was signed by India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in February which aims to boost bilateral trade to $100 billion in the next five years from current $60 billion. The minister said that the detailed text of the pact has been released in public domain and now \u201cwe are trying to complete all our paperwork, all the customs notifications expeditiously. We hope it can be operationalised by May 1, 2022\u201d. Overall, the UAE is offering duty elimination on over 97% of its products which account for 99% of Indian exports here in value terms. Immediate duty-free access covers all labour-intensive sectors such as gems and jewellery, textiles and apparel, agricultural and fish products, leather, footwear, and sport goods, Pharmaceuticals and Medical devices, and many engineering products. \"Currently, we are exporting about $26 billion worth of goods to the UAE , almost 90% of them will get total tariff (or customs duty) elimination on Day 1 itself. Going forward in the next 5-7 or ten years, the rest of the 9.5% (about 1,270 goods) will also get zero duty,\" Mr. Goyal said at the Dubai Expo here. Explaining the importance of the pact, he said the UAE also opened doors for the rest of the Middle East, some parts of Africa and Europe. \u201cThis opens up huge opportunities for Indian businesses,\u201d he said adding the pact also opens doors to several service sectors which will expand job opportunities for Indian young boys and girls. Key areas of India's interest are computer related services, audio visual, education, health, tourism, travel, professionals services like nursing, engineering, and accountancy. \u201cWe are also working for mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) of professionals and skilled services, so that if they approve our nursing colleges then the nursing degree from that college will get automatic recognition here and vice versa,\u201d he said. On the other hand, India has offered significant concessions on goods of export interest to the UAE and that include dates, petroleum products (crude, LPG, Naptha), petrochemicals (polyethylene, polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride), metals (aluminium, copper, nickel, iron and steel), minerals (limestone, cement). India will be giving duty-free access to 7,694 goods on the day of implementation of the agreement. Around 2,400 goods would get zero duty in 5-10 years time period. As part of protective measures in the pact, there are stringent rules of origin criteria that reflect the requirement for substantial processing of up to 40% for most of the products and wholly obtained criteria for agricultural products. When asked about free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Mr. Goyal said: \u201cwe are at an advanced stage of discussion on the scope of the agreement. I believe that discussions will get over in the next 15-20 days\u201d. After that, he said, \u201cwe hope to launch formal negotiations for a broad based FTA with all the GCC nations and that will open up the entire Middle East market for Indian goods and services\u201d. Mr. Goyal, who will participate in the India-UAE Business Forum meet on March 29, said the aim of the meeting is to expand business to business engagements between the countries. The meeting is expected to be attended by businesses including Anish Shah from Mahindra and Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv CMD Sanjiv Bajaj, Vedanta Resources Chairman Anil Agarwal, ITC CMD Sanjiv Puri, Apollo Hospitals Joint MD Sangita Reddy, Bharti Airtel Joint MD Rajan Mittal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd Chairman Satish Reddy, and Byju's cofounder Byju Raveendran.

The PDM comprising the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) retaliated to hold their power show a day later that will coincide with the National Assembly session when the no-confidence motion is set to be formally moved in the house. The JUI-F supporters have started moving under the supervision of local leaders, JUI-F spokesperson Aslam Ghauri told the media. They are mainly coming from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan where the party has a lot of support. Some of them have already reached Hakla Interchange near Islamabad. Another big protest march led by PML-N vice presidents Maryam Nawaz and her cousin Hamza Shehbaz, who is the son of Shehbaz Sharif, started from Lahore on Saturday. Travelling on the historic GT Road, they are scheduled to reach Islamabad on Monday to attend the opposition rally. \u201cIt (the march) will be the last nail in the coffin of the PTI government,\u201d Ms. Maryam told her supporters. Interior minister Sheikh Rashid warned that the Opposition would not be allowed to block any main roads for political activities as it was against the direction of the Supreme Court. \u201cWe have deployed paramilitary Rangers and Frontier Corps along the Srinagar Highway and any effort to block it will be resisted,\u201d he said.Mr. Rashid said that more than 15,000 security personnel would be deployed for keeping law and order and also warned to call the Army in case of any untoward incident. The political temperature has been slowly reaching a boiling point in the wake of the no-trust move by the Opposition on March 8. The make and break point for prime minister Khan is likely to be reached by the end of next week. The Opposition parties are confident that they can get the support of 172 members in the house of 342 to dislodge the government, while the government claims that it enjoys the required support in the house to foil the attempt.Mr. Khan came to power in 2018 with promises to create a \u2018Naya Pakistan\u2019 but miserably failed to address the basic problem of keeping the prices of commodities in control, giving air to the sails of opposition ships to make war on his government. With major allies of Mr. Khan looking the other way and about two dozen PTI members of parliament revolting against him, and the powerful establishment not providing a helping hand, he is less likely to get the support of the much-coveted 172 lawmakers. Mr. Khan, 69, is heading a coalition government and he can be removed if some of the partners decide to switch sides. He is facing a rebellion by his about two dozen lawmakers and allied parties which are also reluctant to pledge support to him. Both Mr. Khan and his ministers are trying to give the impression that everything was fine and he would come out victorious out of the trial. The PTI has 155 members in the 342-member National Assembly and needs at least 172 lawmakers on its side to remain in the government. "

        "title": "\nRussia sowing a deep hatred among Ukrainians, says Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n",
        "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy angrily warned Moscow that it is sowing a deep hatred for Russia among his people, as constant artillery barrages and aerial bombings are reducing cities to rubble, killing civilians and driving others into shelters, leaving them to scrounge for food and water to survive.\u201cYou are doing everything so that our people themselves leave the Russian language, because the Russian language will now be associated only with you, with your explosions and murders, your crimes,\" Zelenskyy said in an impassioned video address late Saturday.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has ground into a war of attrition in many places, with the toll on civilians rising as Moscow seeks to pound cities into submission from entrenched positions.A nuclear research facility in the besieged city of Kharkiv, near the Russian border, again came under fire Saturday, and Ukraine's nuclear watchdog said that because of ongoing hostilities it was impossible to assess the extent of the damage.Kharkiv has been besieged by Russian forces since the start of the invasion and has come under repeated shelling that has hit residential buildings and critical infrastructure.Ukrainian authorities have previously reported that Russian shelling had damaged buildings at the facility, but there had been no release of radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said the nuclear material in the facility is always subcritical and the inventory of radioactive material is very low, reducing the risks of radiation release.On the western side of the country, Russian rockets struck Lviv on Saturday while President Joe Biden visited neighboring Poland, serving as a reminder that Moscow is willing to strike anywhere in Ukraine despite its claim to be focusing its offensive on the country\u2019s east. Early Sunday, a chemical smell still lingered in the air as firefighters in Lviv sprayed water on a burned section of an oil facility hit in the Russian attack. A security guard at the site, Yaroslav Prokopiv, said he saw three rockets strike and destroy two oil tanks but no one was hurt. \u201cThe third strike threw me to the ground,\u201d he said.Russia's back-to-back airstrikes shook the city that has become a haven for an estimated 200,000 people who have had to flee their hometowns. Lviv had been largely spared since the invasion began, although missiles struck an aircraft repair facility near the main airport a week ago.In the dim, crowded bomb shelter under an apartment block a short ways from the first blast site, Olana Ukrainets, a 34-year-old IT professional, said she couldn\u2019t believe she had to hide again after fleeing from the northeastern city of Kharkiv, one of the most bombarded cities of the war.\u201cWe were on one side of the street and saw it on the other side,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw fire. I said to my friend, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 Then we heard the sound of an explosion and glass breaking. We tried to hide between buildings. I don\u2019t know what the target was.\u201dTwo cities on opposite ends of the country are seeing some of the worst suffering at the moment, Chernihiv in the north \u2014 strategically located on the road from the Belarusian border to the capital, Kyiv \u2014 and Mariupol in the south, a key port city on the Sea of Azov. Both are encircled by Russian forces, but still holding out. Chernihiv has been under attack since the early days of the invasion and over the last week, Russia destroyed the main vehicular bridge leading out of the city and rendered a nearby pedestrian bridge impassable, cutting off the last route for civilians to flee, or for food and medicine to be brought in.Chernihiv\u2019s remaining residents are terrified that each blast, bomb and body that lies uncollected on the streets ensnares them in the same macabre trap of unescapable killings and destruction.\u201cIn basements at night, everyone is talking about one thing: Chernihiv becoming (the) next Mariupol,\u201d said 38-year-old resident Ihar Kazmerchak, a linguistics scholar. He spoke to  The Associated Press by cellphone, amid incessant beeps signaling that his battery was dying. The city is without power, running water and heating. At pharmacies, the list of medicines no longer available grows longer by the day.Kazmerchak starts his day in long lines for drinking water, rationed to 10 liters (2 1/2 gallons) per person. People come with empty bottles and buckets for filling when water-delivery trucks make their rounds.\"Food is running out, and shelling and bombing doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d he said.More than half of the city's 280,000 inhabitants have already fled and hundreds who stayed have been killed, Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko said. Russian forces have bombed residential areas from low altitude in \u201cabsolutely clear weather\" and \"are deliberately destroying civilian infrastructure: schools, kindergartens, churches, residential buildings and even the local football stadium,\u201d Atroshenko told Ukrainian television.Refugees from Chernihiv who fled the encirclement and reached Poland this week spoke of broad and terrible destruction, with bombs flattening at least two schools in the city center and strikes also hitting the stadium, museums and many homes. They said that with utilities knocked out, people are taking water from the Desna to drink and that strikes are killing people while they wait in line for food. Volodymyr Fedorovych, 77, said he narrowly escaped a bomb that fell on a bread line he had been standing in just moments earlier. He said the blast killed 16 people and injured dozens, blowing off arms and legs. So intense is the siege that some of those trapped cannot even muster the strength to be afraid anymore, Kazmerchak said. \u201cRavaged houses, fires, corpses in the street, huge aircraft bombs that didn\u2019t explode in courtyards are not surprising anyone anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are simply tired of being scared and don\u2019t even always go down to the basements.\u201dBritain\u2019s defense ministry said Saturday that it doesn't expect a reprieve for citizens of Ukraine's bombarded cities anytime soon.\u201cRussia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties,\u201d the U.K. ministry said.Previous bombings of hospitals and other nonmilitary sites, including a theater in Mariupol where Ukrainian authorities said a Russian airstrike is believed to have killed 300 people last week, already have given rise to war crimes allegations. The invasion has driven more than 10 million people from their homes, almost a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s population. Of those, more than 3.7 million have fled the country entirely, according to the United Nations. Thousands of civilians are believed to have died."

        "text": "The second \u201cblack box\u201d has been recovered from the crash of a China Eastern Boeing 737-800 that killed all 132 people on board last week, Chinese state media said Sunday.Firefighters taking part in the search found the recorder, an orange cylinder, on a mountain slope about 1.5 meters (5 feet) underground, state broadcaster CCTV said. Experts confirmed it was the second black box. The impact of the crash scattered debris widely and created a 20-meter-deep pit in the side of the mountain.Searchers had been looking for the flight data recorder after finding the cockpit voice recorder four days ago. The two recorders should help investigators determine what caused the plane to plummet from 29,000 feet (8,800 meters) and into a forested mountainside in southern China.The search for the black boxes and wreckage from the plane has been complicated by the remote setting and rainy and muddy conditions. Video posted by CGTN, the international arm of CCTV, showed an official holding the orange can-like object on site with the words \u201cRECORDER\u201d and \u201cDO NOT OPEN\u201d written on it. It appeared slightly dented but intact.Flight MU5735 crashed Monday en route from the city of Kunming in southeastern China to Guangzhou, a major city and export manufacturing hub near Hong Kong. An air traffic controller tried to contact the pilots several times after seeing the plane\u2019s altitude drop sharply but got no reply, officials have said.The cockpit voice recorder, also an orange cylinder, was found two days later on Wednesday. It has been sent to Beijing for examination and analysis.Hundreds of searchers have been combing the site outside the city of Wuzhou for days with shovels and other hand tools. Construction excavators have been brought in to remove earth and clear passageways to the site, and pumps are being used to drain collected water from the rain.Officials announced late Saturday that there were no survivors among the 123 passengers and nine crew members. DNA analysis has confirmed the identities of 120 of the people on board, they said. Searchers have found ID and bank cards belonging to the victims.China Eastern, one of China\u2019s four major airlines, and its subsidiaries have grounded all of their Boeing 737-800s, a total of 223 aircraft. The carrier said the grounding was a precaution, not a sign of any problem with the planes.The Boeing Co. said in a statement that a Boeing technical team is supporting the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and the Civil Aviation Administration of China, which will lead the investigation into the crash."

        "text": "At least five people are wounded in two barrages of strikes that damage infrastructure including a fuel storage facility in a rare attack by Russia on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.Russian forces also took control of a town where staff working at the Chernobyl nuclear site live and briefly detain the mayor, sparking protests, Ukrainian officials said.Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden calls his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin a \u201cbutcher\u201d who \u201ccannot remain in power\u201d after meeting top Ukrainian ministers for the first time since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.The conflict began escalating on February 21, 2022, after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and deployed troops in a peacekeeping role.Here are the latest updates:Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief says that Russia could try to break Ukraine in two.\rKyrylo Budanov said in remarks released by the Defense Ministry on Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has realized \u201che can\u2019t swallow the entire country\u201d and would likely try to split the country under \u201cthe Korean scenario.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to the decades-old division between North and South Korea.\rBudanov said that \u201cthe occupiers will try to pull the occupied territories into a single quasi-state structure and pit it against independent Ukraine.\u201d He pointed to Russian attempts to set up parallel government structures in occupied cities and to bar people from using the Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia.\rBudanov predicted that Ukrainian resistance will grow into a \u201ctotal\u201d guerrilla warfare, derailing Russia\u2019s attempts.Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the U.S. is not trying to topple Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite its harsh condemnations of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Blinken spoke a day after President Joe Biden said of Putin during a speech in Warsaw: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man cannot remain in power.\u201dAt a news conference in Jerusalem, Mr. Blinken said Mr. Biden\u2019s point was that \u201cPutin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else.\u201dHe said the U.S. has repeatedly said that \u201cwe do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia, or anywhere else for that matter.\u201dU.S. President Joe Biden met with Ukrainian ministers Saturday, as Russia signalled it may scale down its war aims after failing to break the nation\u2019s resistance in a month of fighting and deadly attacks on civilians.During the meeting, Mr. Biden was seated at a long white table alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin facing Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov, a White House pool report said.The U.S. leader has been leading efforts among Western allies to press Vladimir Putin to end his invasion of Ukraine, branding the Russian president as a \u201cwar criminal\u201d over the assaults on civilians.Mr. Putin had sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, vowing to destroy the country\u2019s military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and its attacks on civilians have become more deadly. In a surprise statement, Sergei Rudskoi, a senior Russian general, suggested the time had come for a considerably reduced \u201cmain goal\u201d of controlling Donbas, an eastern region already partly held by Russian proxies.The apparent scaling down of ambitions came as a Western official reported that a seventh Russian general, Lieutenant General Yakov Rezanstev, had died in Ukraine and that a colonel had been \u201cdeliberately\u201d killed by his own demoralised men. - AFPRussia has signalled it may dial back its war aims to focus on eastern Ukraine after failing to break the nation\u2019s resistance in a month of fighting and attacks on civilians, including up to 300 feared killed in the bombing of a theatre.The possible shift came ahead of a planned meeting by U.S. President Joe Biden with Ukrainian refugees in Poland and talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda in Warsaw before he gives a speech on the \u201cbrutal war\u201d, the White House said.Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the February invasion to destroy Ukraine\u2019s military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky, bringing the country under Russia\u2019s sway.But Sergei Rudskoi, a senior general, suggested a considerably reduced \u201cmain goal\u201d of controlling Donbas, an eastern region already partly held by Russian proxies.His surprise statement came as a Western official reported that a seventh Russian general, Lieutenant General Yakov Rezanstev, had died in Ukraine and that a colonel had been \u201cdeliberately\u201d killed by his own demoralised men.Complicating Moscow\u2019s challenges, invasion troops were facing a counteroffensive in Kherson, the only major Ukrainian city under Russian control.Visiting Rzeszow, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Ukraine, Mr. Biden praised Ukraine\u2019s \u201cincredible\u201d resistance, comparing the conflict to a bigger version of communist China\u2019s 1989 crushing of protests in Tiananmen Square.Mr. Biden told soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division that the struggle in eastern Europe represents a historic \u201cinflection point\u201d. \u201cAre democracies going to prevail... or are autocracies going to prevail? And that\u2019s really what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Mr. Biden said. The U.S. leader was briefed on the humanitarian situation, with more than 3.7 million refugees fleeing Ukraine, most of them into Poland.Earlier, he ended a trip to Brussels for meetings with Western allies by announcing new measures to help the European Union shed dependence on imported Russian energy.The plan is part of a sea change in the West, which for years has shrunk from direct confrontation with the Kremlin, but now seeks to make Putin a pariah. - AFPThe Russian military appears to be trying to encircle Ukrainian forces fighting in the separatist regions in the eastern part of the country, Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defense says.Russian forces are advancing southward from the area around Kharkiv and north from Mariupol, the ministry said in an intelligence briefing released Sunday morning.Battlefields in northern Ukraine remain \u201clargely static,\u201d with Ukrainian counterattacks hampering Russian efforts to reorganize their forces, the ministry said.- APUkraine and Russia have agreed two \u2018humanitarian corridors\u2019 to evacuate civilians from frontline areas on Sunday, including allowing people to leave by private car from the southern city of Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.- ReutersUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy angrily warned Moscow that it is sowing a deep hatred for Russia among his people, as constant artillery barrages and aerial bombings are reducing cities to rubble, killing civilians and driving others into shelters, leaving them to scrounge for food and water to survive.\u201cYou are doing everything so that our people themselves leave the Russian language, because the Russian language will now be associated only with you, with your explosions and murders, your crimes,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an impassioned video address late Saturday.- APUkraine\u2019s nuclear watchdog says that a nuclear research facility in Kharkiv again has come under shelling by Russia and the fighting makes it impossible to assess the damage.The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate said that the neutron source experimental facility in the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology came under fire Saturday.Ukrainian authorities have previously reported that Russian shelling damaged buildings at the Kharkiv facility, but there has been no release of radiation.- APRussian forces took control of a town where staff working at the Chernobyl nuclear site live and briefly detained the mayor, sparking protests, Ukrainian officials said Saturday.\u201cI have been released. Everything is fine, as far as it is possible under occupation,\u201d Yuri Fomichev, mayor of Slavutych, told AFP by phone, after officials in the Ukraine capital Kyiv announced earlier he had been detained.Earlier, the military administration of the Kyiv region, which covers Slavutych, announced that Russian troops had entered the town and occupied the municipal hospital.They also said that the mayor had been detained.- AFP-\u00a0Ukraine said Saturday that the United States does not object to the transfer of war planes to Kyiv to help it fend off the Russian invasion, after the Pentagon previously rejected an offer from Poland.Officials in Washington \u201chave no objections to the transfer of aircrafts. As far as we can conclude, the ball is now on the Polish side. We will look further into this matter in our conversations with Polish colleagues\u201d, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in written comments to AFPA total of 5,208 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Saturday, a senior official said, fewer than the 7,331 who managed to escape the previous day.Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president\u2019s office, said in an online post that 4,331 people had left the besieged city of Mariupol.- ReutersThe governor of the Lviv region says a man was detained on suspicion of espionage at the site of one of the two rocket attacks that rattled the city on Saturday.Maksym Kozytskyy said police found the man had recorded a rocket flying toward the target and striking it.

Most candidates ran as independents, though many have ties to Mr. Abbas' Fatah party, and the outcomes will largely depend on local dynamics. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, is boycotting the elections and refusing to hold them in the isolated territory. A first round was held in December in rural areas, where local politics are dominated by powerful families. Saturday's voting was held in urban areas, where there is more visible opposition to Fatah, but the local elections are unlikely to produce any clear referendum on its leadership. Of the 102 localities, only 50 saw more than one electoral list compete, according to the Central Elections Commission. Municipal elections were last held in 2017. Ruhaifah Abdelrahim, a politically independent retired schoolteacher, said she was determined to exercise her right to vote whenever she could. \u201cPeople are always demonstrating, always talking... but how are we supposed to change the situation or improve it if there are no elections?\u201d she said after voting at an elementary school. \u201cGodwilling, there will be parliamentary elections so the people can choose leaders who will serve the country and the nation. People are really suffering from the occupation, from the poor administration and corruption.\u201d A steady stream of voters could be seen outside polling stations in and around the West Bank city of Ramallah, where the PA is headquartered. A few people waved Fatah flags outside one of them, and a large banner promoting one of the few official Fatah lists hung alongside others advertising independents. The elections commission said 3,77,895 people voted, or 52.82% of those eligible. Official results are expected Sunday. The commission is widely respected for being professional and impartial. The internationally recognised PA administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank in accordance with agreements reached in the 1990s and coordinates with Israel on security, something that is deeply unpopular among Palestinians. Support for Mr. Abbas has plummeted in recent years as the PA has come to be seen as increasingly corrupt and authoritarian. Israel's occupation of lands the Palestinians want for a future state is well into its sixth decade, with no end in sight. The last serious and substantive peace talks ground to a halt more than a decade ago.Mr. Abbas indefinitely postponed the first parliamentary elections in 15 years last April, citing Israel's refusal to say whether it would permit voting in east Jerusalem. At the time, his Fatah party had split into three factions and appeared headed for another defeat.Hamas won by a landslide in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2006. That exacerbated a long-running rivalry with Mr. Fatah, leading to a week of heavy fighting in Gaza that left Hamas in control of the territory. The two factions have been unable to agree on holding elections since then, and Mr. Abbas remained in power after his presidential term expired in 2009.Mr. Abbas' popularity declined even further after last year's Gaza war, which gave Hamas a major boost. Mr. Fatah has regained support since then, but Abbas remains deeply unpopular, according to the most recent poll by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey research. His most recent survey found that 73% of Palestinians want Mr. Abbas to resign, and that a majority of 55% view the PA as more of a burden than an asset. When asked about the local elections, just 14% said they would vote based on political party, while the largest percentage, 42%, said they would decide based on the delivery of local services. Pollsters interviewed 1,200 Palestinians face-to-face across the West Bank. The margin of error was three percentage points. \u201cI'm sure Fatah will want to highlight its victories,\" said Hugh Lovatt, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations who closely follows Palestinian politics. \"It's a bit misleading, because in a lot of cases they aren't running against anyone.\" The elections will likely help the PA with European donor countries, which had expressed support for last year's elections but failed to convince Israel to explicitly allow voting in east Jerusalem. Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with the West Bank and Gaza, in the 1967 war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state and consider east Jerusalem their capital. The Israeli army detained Islam al-Tawil, the head of an independent list in the town of Al-Bireh, near Ramallah, a week before voting. The military said he was suspected of being a member of Hamas, which Israel and Western countries consider to be a terrorist group. His supporters deny the allegation, saying he led a list of young political outsiders who were determined to bring about change. \u201cThey don't want anyone who is a leader, who is young, who is Muslim, to lead this country, so they came and took him,\u201d said Abdelhakim al-Taim, a candidate from his list. Any change in the Palestinian national leadership appears unlikely under the 86-year-old Mr. Abbas, who has no clear successor. Reconciliation talks with Hamas have repeatedly collapsed, most recently after the election postponement last year.Mr. Lovatt said parliamentary elections would have splintered Mr. Fatah, and that Mr. Abbas would most likely lose in a presidential election. \u201cWith municipal elections, I think the risk factor for Fatah or for the Abbas leadership is much smaller,\u201d he said."

Joe Balogh told the Chicago Tribune on Saturday.Police did not release a motive for the shooting but said it was a targeted attack.The gunman then fled in a car with \u201cother unknown subjects, he said.More than two hours after the shooting, police stopped that vehicle on an expressway in Chicago, Mr. Balogh said.

        "text": "Russian rockets struck the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Saturday while President Joe Biden visited neighboring Poland, a reminder that Moscow is willing to strike anywhere in Ukraine despite its claim to be focusing its offensive on the country\u2019s east.The back-to-back airstrikes shook the city that has become a haven for an estimated 2,00,000 people who have had to flee their hometowns. Lviv had been largely spared since the invasion began, although missiles struck an aircraft repair facility near the main airport a week ago.Among the many who sought refuge in Lviv is Olana Ukrainets, a 34-year-old IT worker from the northeastern city of Kharkiv.\u201cWhen I came to Lviv, I was sure that all these alarms wouldn\u2019t have any results,\u201d Ukrainets told The Associated Press from a bomb shelter after the blasts. \u201cSometimes when I heard them at night, I just stayed in bed. Today, I changed my mind and I should hide every time. \u2026 None of the Ukrainian cities are safe now.\u201dThe city was home to about 7,00,000 people before the invasion. Some who no longer feel safe here will head for nearby Poland. Mr. Biden met there Saturday with refugees in a show of solidarity, though he was in the capital, Warsaw, and far from the Ukrainian border, which is only about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of Lviv.Lviv also has become a humanitarian staging ground for Ukraine, and the attacks could further complicate the already challenging process of sending aid to the rest of the country.The first strike involved two Russian rockets that hit an industrial area in the northeastern outskirts of Lviv and apparently injured five people, the regional governor, Maxym Kozytsky, said on Facebook. A thick, black plume of smoke billowed from the site for hours.A second rocket attack occurred just outside the city hours later and caused three explosions, Mr. Kozytsky told a press briefing as another round of air raid sirens wailed. He said an oil facility and factory connected to the military, both in areas where people live, were struck Saturday, though he didn\u2019t give more details.In the dim, crowded bomb shelter under an apartment block a short ways from the first blast site, Ukrainets said she couldn\u2019t believe she had to hide again after fleeing from Kharkiv, one of the most bombarded cities of the war.\u201cWe were on one side of the street and saw it on the other side,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw fire.

I don\u2019t know what the target was.\u201dThe day's events were enough to make some people in Lviv prepare to move again, said Michael Bociurkiw, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council who is in the city. \u201cI saw some Kyiv cars being packed up,\u201d he said. It was a significant turn in a week where the city had begun \u201croaring back\u201d to life after weeks of war, he said.He believes the city could remain a target, noting that Lviv was the birthplace of Ukrainian nationalism. \u201cIt's getting closer,\u201d he said of the war.Some witnesses were in shock.\u201cIt was really close,\" said Inga Kapitula, a 24-year-old IT worker who said she was 100 or 200 meters (yards) away from the first attack and felt the blast wave. \u201cWhen it happens, your body's in stress and you're super calm and organised.\""

        "title": "\nBiden on Putin: 'This man cannot remain in power'\n",
        "text": "U.S. President Joe Biden said Saturday that Vladimir Putin \u201ccannot remain in power,\u201d dramatically escalating the rhetoric against the Russian leader after his brutal invasion of Ukraine. Even as Mr. Biden's words rocketed around the world, the White House attempted to clarify soon after Mr. Biden finished speaking in Poland that he was not calling for a new government in Russia. A White House official asserted that Mr. Biden was \u201cnot discussing Putin's power in Russia or regime change.\u201d The official, who was not authorized to comment by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Biden's point was that \u201cPutin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region.\u201d The White House declined to comment on whether Biden's statement about Putin was part of his prepared remarks. \u201cFor God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,\" Mr. Biden's said at the very end of a speech in Poland's capital that served as the capstone on a four-day trip to Europe.Mr. Biden has frequently talked about ensuring that the Kremlin's now invasion, now in its second month, becomes a \u201cstrategic failure\u201d for Mr. Putin and has described the Russian leader as a \u201cwar criminal\". But until his remarks in Warsaw, the American leader had not veered toward suggesting Mr. Putin should not run Russia. Earlier on Saturday, shortly after meeting with Ukrainian refugees, Mr. Biden called Mr. Putin a \u201cbutcher.\u201d Mr. Biden also used his speech to also make a vociferous defense of liberal democracy and the NATO military alliance, while saying Europe must steel itself for a long fight against Russian aggression. Earlier in the day, as BMr. iden met with Ukrainian refugees, Russia kept up its pounding of cities throughout Ukraine. Explosions rang out in Lviv, the closest major Ukrainian city to Poland and a destination for the internally replaced that has been largely spared from major attacks. The images of Mr. Biden reassuring refugees and calling for Western unity contrasted with the dramatic scenes of flames and black smoke billowing so near the Polish border - another jarring split-screen moment in the war. In what was billed by the White House as a major address, Mr. Biden spoke inside the Royal Castle, one of Warsaw's notable landmarks that was badly damaged during War II. He borrowed the words of Polish-born Pope John Paul II and cited anti-communist Polish dissident and former president, Lech Walesa, as he warned that Putin's invasion of Ukraine threatens to bring \u201cdecades of war.\u201d \"In this battle we need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days, or months, either,\u201d Mr. Biden said. The crowd of about 1,000 included some of the Ukrainian refugees who have fled for Poland and elsewhere in the midst of the brutal invasion. \u201cWe must commit now, to be this fight for the long haul,\u201d Mr. Biden said. After meeting with refugees at the National Stadium, Mr. Biden marvelled at their spirit and resolve in the aftermath of Russia's deadly invasion as he embraced mothers and children and promised enduring support from Western powers.Mr. Biden listened intently as children described the perilous flight from neighbouring Ukraine with their parents. Smiling broadly, he lifted up a young girl in a pink coat and told her she reminded him of his granddaughters. The U.S. President held hands with parents and gave them hugs during the stop at the soccer stadium where refugees go to obtain a Polish identification number that gives them access to social services such as health care and schools. Some of the women and children told Biden that they fled without their husbands and fathers, men of fighting age who were required to remain behind to aid the resistance against Putin's forces. \u201cWhat I am always surprised by is the depth and strength of the human spirit,\u201d Biden told reporters after his conversations with the refugees at the stadium, which more recently had served as a field hospital for COVID-19 patients. \u201cEach one of those children said something to the effect of, 'Say a prayer for my dad or grandfather or my brother who is out there fighting.\"  The U.S. president tried to use his final hours of his European trip reassuring Poland that the United States would defend against any attacks by Russia as he acknowledged that the NATO ally bore the burden of the refugee crisis from the war. \u201cYour freedom is ours,\" Mr. Biden told Poland's president, Andrzej Duda earlier, echoing one of that country's unofficial mottos. More than 3.7 million people have fled Ukraine since the war began, and more than 2.2 million Ukrainians have crossed into Poland, though it is unclear how many have remained there and how many have left for other countries. Earlier this week the U.S. announced it would take in as many as 100,000 refugees, and Mr. Biden told Mr. Duda that he understood Poland was \u201ctaking on a big responsibility, but it should be all of NATO's responsibility.\u201d Mr. Biden called the \u201ccollective defence\u201d agreement of NATO a \u201csacred commitment,\" and said the unity of the Western military alliance was of the utmost importance. \u201cI'm confident that Vladimir Putin was counting on dividing NATO,\" Mr. Biden said. \"But he hasn't been able to do it. We've all stayed together.\u201d European security is facing its most serious test since World War II. Western leaders have spent the past week consulting over contingency plans in case the conflict spreads. The invasion has shaken NATO out of any complacency it might have felt and cast a dark shadow over Europe. Warsaw, a city of nearly 1.8 million people, has grown by about 17% in a month as the refugees have come in huge numbers seeking shelter. While Poles have so far welcomed Ukrainians, the humanitarian efforts are largely the work of volunteers. Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski has warned it is not sustainable and that social services are buckling under the strain. The U.S. has been sending money and supplies to aid the refugee effort. This week, Mr. Biden announced $1 billion in additional aid in addition to accepting refugees. The U.S. and many of its allies have imposed multiple rounds of economic and other sanctions on Russian individuals, banks and other entities in hopes that the cumulative effect over time will force Mr. Putin to withdraw his troops. But no clear path to ending the conflict has emerged. Although Russian officials have suggested they will focus their invasion on the Donbas, a region in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Biden told reporters, when asked whether the Kremlin had changed its strategy, \u201cI am not sure they have.\" "

        "text": "In a forceful speech in Warsaw denouncing Russia's Vladimir Putin and praising Ukrainians, U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday also appeared to have a more subtle message for his Polish hosts.Speaking of a \u201cperennial struggle for democracy,\u201d Mr. Biden mentioned the rule of law and freedom of the press among the principles essential in a free society.He made his remarks in a speech attended by President Andrzej Duda and his conservative political allies in the ruling Law and Justice party. Since they won power in 2015, they have been accused by the European Union of eroding the rule of law with changes that have given the party vast new powers over the judicial judicial branch of government.Mr. Biden paid homage to Poland's long struggle for democracy in his speech that he delivered at the Royal Castle, which like most of Warsaw was destroyed by the occupying Nazi German forces during World War II and was later rebuilt.He said Warsaw \u201cholds a sacred place in the history of not only of Europe but humankind's unending search for freedom. For generations Warsaw has stood where liberty has been challenged and liberty has prevailed.\u201d The American leader observed that democratic values \u201chave always been under siege, they have always been embattled.\u201d \u201cEvery generation has had to defeat democracy's moral foes,\u201d Mr. Biden said.Liberal critics of Mr. Duda and the government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki have been concerned that with the war in Ukraine, Poland's rising importance as a key NATO country on the eastern flank could lead the United States and the EU to let up on the pressure on Warsaw over the rule of law.Mr. Duda clearly preferred Mr. Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, and waited weeks after the U.S. election in 2020 to congratulate Biden.But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted Duda and some other European populists to unite with Democrats in the United States and European leaders whom they had been in conflict with for years.Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Poland has accepted the lion's share of the more than 3.5 million Ukrainians who have fled.At the same time Poland is hosting some 10,000 U.S. troops, thousands of them arriving recently to help with the humanitarian crisis. Poland is also a base for sending military help into Ukraine, something that makes the country feel more vulnerable.The Polish authorities were also in conflict with Washington last year over legal attempts to silence TVN, a broadcast network owned by the U.S. company Discovery Inc. The aim was to strip Discovery of its control of TVN, which produces independent news programs that are critical of the government.Mr. Duda late last year vetoed the legislation, but concerns about press freedom remain due to the government's use of public media as a party mouthpiece.At the start of his speech Mr. Biden paid homage to two great Poles of modern history, John Paul II, the first Polish-born pope, and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.\u201cWhile I know he couldn't be here tonight, we're all grateful in America and around the world to Lech Walesa,\u201d Mr. Biden said, in a direct appeal to bridge the deep divides in Polish society.Walesa is a harsh critic of Poland's right-wing government and often accuses it of eroding the democracy that he helped to usher in.Ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski and his allies have sought to significantly play down Walesa's historic role in the successful fight against communism. They also accuse him of making too many compromises in the transition to democracy, something Walesa and others believes was necessary to prevent bloodshed then. "

Two weeks ago, the company increased the price of gasoline by 25%.The company said the 30% depreciation of the rupee against the U.S. dollar and other major currencies this month fuelled the increase.There was no immediate price revision from the state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation but its representatives, who asked to remain anonymous, told AFP it was almost certain to follow Lanka IOC.Sri Lanka is in the grip of its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948.The island's foreign reserves have hit rock bottom, with commercial banks unable to secure dollars to finance imports of food, fuel and medicines.At least four persons have died while waiting in long queues to buy fuel in the past week.Sri Lanka was in a deep economic crisis when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, reducing foreign worker remittances and crippling the lucrative tourism sector \u2014 a key source of dollars for the economy.The government imposed a broad import ban in March 2020 to save foreign currency.The shortages pushed food prices up 25% last month, with overall inflation at 17.5% \u2014 the fifth consecutive monthly record high.Sri Lanka is also facing five-hour rolling electricity blackouts as thermal generators have run out of oil.Three international rating agencies have downgraded the island since late last year, on fears it may not be able to service its $51 billion sovereign debt.Sri Lanka announced earlier this month that it will seek an IMF bailout and talks are expected to open next month in Washington."

Justice, justice!\" chanted protesters on Saturday, some carrying school books as they gathered at a city square in Kabul.They held banners that said: \"Education is our fundamental right, not a political plan\" as they marched for a short distance and later dispersed as Taliban fighters arrived at the scene.The protest was the first held by women in weeks after the Taliban rounded up the ringleaders of initial demonstrations held after they returned to power in August.The Islamists have not given a clear reason for their decision, which came after a meeting late on Tuesday of senior officials in the southern city of Kandahar, the Taliban's de facto power centre and spiritual heartland.It followed months of work by some foreign countries on a plan to support the payment of teachers' wages. Afghan secondary school girls have now been out of education for more than seven months.\"Even the Prophet (Mohammed) said everyone has the right to education, but the Taliban have snatched this right from us,\" said youngster Nawesa at the demonstration, which was organised by two women's rights groups.\"The Taliban can not oppress the women of Afghanistan,\" said another protester, Laila Basim.Since returning to power on August 15, the Taliban have rolled back two decades of gains made by the country's women, who have been squeezed out of many government jobs, barred from travelling alone, and ordered to dress according to a strict interpretation of the Koran.The Taliban had promised a softer version of the harsh Islamist rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001.But many restrictions have still been imposed \u2014 if not at the national level then implemented locally at the whim of regional officials.Some Afghan women initially pushed back against the Taliban's curbs, holding small protests where they demanded the right to education and work.But the Taliban soon rounded up the ringleaders, holding them incommunicado while denying that they had been detained.Since their release, most have gone silent."

        "text": "Joe Biden on Saturday in Warsaw met two Ukrainian ministers in the first face-to-face talks between the U.S. President and top Kyiv officials since Russia's invasion began.Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov made a rare trip out of Ukraine in a possible sign of growing confidence in the fightback against Russian forces.The meeting took place at the Marriott Hotel in the city centre \u2014 opposite a Warsaw train station where there has been a constant flow of Ukrainian refugees since the conflict started.Mr. Biden could be seen seated at a long white table between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, facing Kuleba and Reznikov, an AFP reporter said.There were Ukrainian and U.S. flags in the background.The officials discussed \"the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters.Mr. Blinken and Mr. Austin \"pledged continued support to meet Ukraine's humanitarian, security, and economic needs,\" he added.Mr. Biden last met Mr. Kuleba in Washington on February 22 \u2014 two days before Russia began its assault.Since then, Mr. Kuleba also met Mr. Blinken in Poland next to the border with Ukraine on March 5.Mr. Biden is on the second and final day of a visit to Poland after he met with EU and NATO leaders in Brussels earlier in the week.After talking to the Ukrainian ministers, Mr. Biden met with Polish President Andrzej Duda at the presidential palace.On Friday, the U.S. president spoke to U.S. soldiers stationed in Poland near the Ukrainian border and aid workers helping refugees fleeing the conflict.He praised Ukrainians for showing \"backbone\" against the Russian invasion and compared their resistance to the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in China in 1989.\"This is Tiananmen Square squared,\" he said.He also referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"a man who, quite frankly, I think is a war criminal\".\"And I think we'll meet the legal definition of that as well,\" he said.Mr. Biden said he would have liked to see the devastation caused by the conflict \"first-hand\".\"They won't let me, understandably I guess, cross the border,\" he said.Speaking to the troops, he said: \"You're in the midst of a fight between democracies and autocrats. What you're doing is consequential, really consequential.\"Later on Saturday, he is due to visit a reception centre for refugees and give a major speech on the conflict."

        "title": "\nMariupol | Battle for the east\n",
        "text": "Mariupol sits on the coast of the Azov Sea between the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, and the self-declared Donetsk republic, which President Vladimir Putin recognised as independent, along with the Luhansk republic, before ordering the invasion of Ukraine. On February 24, Russia started the war on three fronts \u2014 in Ukraine\u2019s north, from the Belarus border towards Kyiv and Kharkiv, in the east, from the rebel-controlled Donbas and in the south, from Crimea. As the war has entered the second month, the main effort of the Russian troops is on the eastern front as their advances in the south and north appear to have stalled. And at the heart of the battle for the east is Mariupol, which has been under siege for weeks.Named after Maria Feodorovna, the 18th century Russian empress, Mariupol was part of the Azov Governorate of imperial Russia. In the 18th century, Russia settled Orthodox Christians from Crimea in Mariupol, at the mouth of the Kalmius river that flows into the Azov Sea. Over the years, it emerged as one of the biggest trading centres on the Black Sea and Azov coasts.\u00a0By the late 19th century, the city became a steel manufacturing hub, attracting thousands of workers from around the region. During the Second World War, Mariupol was occupied by the German Nazis, for almost two years. This period also saw a systematic campaign to exterminate the city\u2019s Jewish population\u00a0by the Nazi forces and their local collaborators. After the city was liberated by the Red Army, its name was changed to Zhdanov, after Andrei Zhdanov, a Soviet communist leader. It would become Mariupol again in 1989 , two years ahead of the demise of the Soviet Union.If Odessa is \u2018the pearl of the Black Sea\u2019, Mariupol, the largest port of the Sea of Azov, was the industrial engine of eastern Ukraine. But everything would change in 2014 after the so-called \u201cEuromaidan revolution\u201d, which the Russians call a coup, brought down the elected government of President Viktor Yanukovych that were openly backed by the West.Rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk took up arms against the new authorities in Kyiv. Russia supported the rebels who seized parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, which is collectively called Donbas, and annexed Crimea through a referendum. This turned Mariupol, a city of about half a million people (a majority of them Russian speaking), into a battlefield. Mariupol briefly fell into the hands of pro-Russian rebels. But they faced strong resistance from a local neo-Nazi militia called the Azov Battalion. In June 2014, the rebels retreated from the city, giving it back to the Ukrainian authorities. Later, the Azov Battalion became part of the Ukrainian National Guards.When President Putin declared his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d, he put forward two vague military goals \u2013 \u201cdenazification and demilitarisation\u201d of Ukraine. While these goals are open for interpretation,\u00a0 it was evident that the Russians wanted to take Mariupol, which was critical for Russia for many reasons. First, the city is part of the areas claimed by the Donetsk republic. So if Mr. Putin\u2019s actual military goal is separating the entire Donbas region from Ukraine, he would need Mariupol.\u00a0Second, the city hosts the headquarters of the Azov Battalion. As \u201cdenazification\u201d is one of the declared goals of Russia\u2019s invasion, they would want to take over the city and declare victory over the neo-Nazi group.\u00a0Third, the strategic location of Mariupol is critical for Russia if it wants to establish \u201ca land bridge\u201d from Donbas to Crimea. The Russians have already established a partial land bridge but taking over the city would provide them seamless access from continental Russia to Crimea. Lastly, with Mariupol in their hand, the Russians would be in control of almost 80% of the Black Sea coast.Russian troops have already captured almost 70% of the city and are now fighting in the city centre. In the past three weeks, Russians were accused of carrying out heavy bombardment and shelling in the besieged city. The Russian attack on a maternity hospital, in which three people were killed, had triggered widespread international criticism. Ukrainian authorities also blamed Russia for attacking a theatre that was sheltering civilians. Russian forces, on the other side, claim that civilians are being used as human shields by the Azov Battalion.As Ukraine is unable to resupply its forces holed up in the city, including the Azov Battalion, and Russians are making incremental advances, Mariupol could fall in the coming days or weeks, according to an assessment by the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War. For Russia, whose slow military gains in Ukraine have raised questions about its military planning and execution, seizing Mariupol would not only be a major military victory but also free up combat resources, which would allow them to reinforce other fronts."

        "title": "\nA moment of crisis for Imran and his party\n",
        "text": "Spring is the season for revival but in Pakistan, spring usually brings political intrigues. This year\u2019s season of political intrigues came close to its climax on Friday when the National Assembly convened as the ongoing war of words touched a new low between the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf- (PTI)-led Government of Prime Minister Imran Khan and the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), comprised the Pakistan Muslim League- Nawaz (PML-N), the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Maulana Fazlur Rahman\u2019s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. Both sides liberally labelled each other as \u201cfat rodents\u201d that are found in the underbelly of urban spaces. It was said that only God could save Mr. Khan from being ousted as the opposition is ready to hold the final phase of discussions on a no-confidence motion, blaming the Prime Minister for mismanaging the country, economy and foreign policy. Several MP\u2019s from the PM\u2019s party have also come out against him.The battle in Parliament is set to begin on March 28, Monday, when the National Assembly is set to reconvene.The spring of intrigues in 2022 is also a bit of a payback from Pakistan\u2019s Opposition to Mr. Khan. In February 2012, Mr. Khan had launched a movement accusing the government of Yousef Raza Gilani and Asif Ali Zardari of corruption. He had claimed that the rulers of Pakistan did not have answers to his questions about how they amassed wealth. Mr. Khan and the PTI kicked up a storm over a Swiss bank account with $60 million that allegedly belonged to Mr. Zardari.The PTI was created by Mr. Khan in 1996 in the middle of a decade that was marked by terrorism and urban violence in South Asia. But until 2012, he remained a fringe player as bigger stars like Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto dominated the democratic landscape. Political opportunity finally emerged at the end of the rule of General Pervez Musharraf. Gen. Musharraf had reached out to the exiled former Prime Minister Sharif and Bhutto. Following a deal, Gen. Musharraf brought the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) under which the corruption cases against the two were placed beyond the ambit of investigation.In 2007, Bhutto was assassinated by mystery killers who remained unidentified till date, but the subsequent political order was shaped by Mr. Zardari and Mr. Sharif . In 2012, Mr. Khan with the intervention of controversial Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, was able to question the premise behind the NRO and the post-Musharraf political consensus that suited both the leading political parties. Mr. Khan\u2019s PTI launched the \u2018Naya Pakistan\u2019 campaign in 2013, which ultimately catapulted him to power in 2018.\u00a0The PDM and the PML-N had consistently stated that the election was rigged by the military establishment in favour of Mr. Khan as they wanted to take control through a technocratic proxy. There have long been rumours that the security establishment that is the real backroom player of Pakistani democracy tried to reach out to Mr. Sharif during his time in jail following his arrest in July 2018 but the former Prime Minister refused to play according to the military rule book.Mr. Sharif, who is abroad now, has given the task of mobilising supporters to his feisty daughter Maryam, who has been on a cross country tour harvesting public anger over economic woes, unemployment and high inflation. Pakistan, as per the World Bank, is among the top 10 countries with the largest foreign debt stocks. Pakistan\u2019s economy remains largely dependent on external financing as it has failed to revive its productive sectors. With disgruntlement growing, the Twitter handle of the Embassy of Pakistan in Serbia last December let out the cat when an unhappy official wondered how long officials are expected to stay quiet despite the fact that they had not been paid for three months. Islamabad later clarified that the handle was hacked. However, the tweet made it well known across the world that the Pakistani economy has reached a crisis point with even government employees going unpaid for months.Mr. Khan had promised to rid Pakistan of corruption which had marred its experience with democracy. As his government failed to provide any stable solution to the economic problems of Pakistan, his government\u2019s focus remained on the high voltage politics over the \u2018Old Pakistan\u2019. However, increasingly allegations suggested that Mr. Khan had turned out to be the opposite of what he had promised. He was expected to provide a rational technocratic leadership in an orthodox society, but his former wife Meham Khan claimed that he believes in black magic and loved exotic massages to ward off the evil eye. There are also rumours of corruption that allegedly involve his close relatives. As the no-confidence motion was registered at the National Assembly on March 8 by the opposition parties, Mr. Khan tried to project it as a foreign plot. He alleged that the opposition had criticised him for denying military base to the U.S. which wanted a foothold in Pakistan after exiting Afghanistan in August 2021. Mr. Khan has been a long-term critic of the U.S.\u2019s actions in neighbouring Afghanistan and he had criticised the handling of the U.S. by both the Musharraf and Sharif governments of the past. His non-alignment type diplomatic style ultimately led him to Moscow where he was hosted by President Vladimir Putin on February 24, the day Russia launched the attack on Ukraine. In Russia, Mr. Khan received an assurance about possible energy collaboration between the two sides, which further irked his opponents who interpreted this as a move by an increasingly unpopular leader trying to impress his already disappointed voters. In the similar style, he praised Indian military for staying out of politics and praised India for its independent foreign policy. But these too were interpreted by the opposition as gambles from a sinking PM. After the NA was adjourned by the Speaker on Friday, there are reports that Mr. Khan has met Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa and urged the military leaders to control the political Opposition as he has decided to advance the date of election to October. It is being said Mr. Khan will make the announcement on this issue on Sunday, which is expected to be a day of high tension as both the anti-government PDM led by Maulana Rahman, and Mr. Khan\u2019s PTI are expected to hold rallies in a bid to show strength. There remain concerns of violence breaking out between the two sides, unless, of course, PM Khan pulls out his last-minute surprise that may address the demands from the Opposition."

        "text": "India has asked Sri Lanka to \u201cexercise caution\u201d and prevent casualties while cracking down on fishing boats (belonging to Tamil Nadu). It has suggested that the neighbouring country use a paramilitary force (instead of the Navy) to deal with civilian fishermen found on its territorial waters.This was among the points discussed at the fifth meeting of the bilateral Joint Working Group on Fisheries, which was held virtually on Friday.R.M.I. Rathnayake, Secretary, Sri Lanka\u2019s Ministry of Fisheries, and Jatindra Nath Swain, Secretary, Fisheries, Government of India, led the delegations. The Joint Working Group met last in December 2020, according to a\u00a0release issued by the High Commission of India, Colombo, on Saturday.The Indian delegation included representatives of the Tamil Nadu Department of Fisheries, an official in Chennai said.India told Sri Lanka that the relevant clauses of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) were \u201cfishermen- friendly\u201d in letter and spirit, besides calling upon the other side to approach the fisheries issue in a humanitarian way. \u201cBoth countries agreed that the use of force could not be justified under any circumstances and reiterated the importance of humane treatment of all fishermen,\u201d the release said.Sri Lanka\u00a0voiced concerns over the methods used by fishing vessels (of Tamil Nadu) and said, \u201cit is imperative for the two countries to work together in drawing up effective measures to mitigate the loss of livelihood\u201d. India assured the neighbouring country of its assistance, besides explaining the steps it had taken \u2014 education, financial support and guidance, among others \u2014 to help Indian fishermen switch to long-line fishing."

        "text": "If you blinked you may have missed the Chinese Foreign Minister\u2019s trip to Delhi on Friday- not only were his official meetings just a few hours, the visit was completely unannounced, and there was no build up of expectations.Mr. Wang flew into Delhi after visits to Islamabad and Kabul. At the airport, apparently by the Chinese request, there were no photos of his reception. The next day he held a 1 hour meeting with NSA Ajit Doval, followed by a 3 hour meeting and lunch with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, before he left for Kathmandu.Even so, the importance of the visit for both China and India cannot be downplayed- primarily for what it means for bilateral relations that have been ruptured over Chinese actions at the LAC:This is the first such visit to India by a senior Chinese official since hostilities at the Line of Actual Control began in April 2020 after PLA amassed troops and transgressed Indian territory along the Line in Ladakh- and the Galwan clash that left 20 Indian soldiers, and an undeclared number of Chinese soldiers dead.The visit by the Chinese FM, and the acceptance of the visit by India is a break from the past 2 years, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi has only attended multilateral events online with Chinese President Xi- like the BRICS, SCO and G-20, while EAM Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh have only met their counterparts to discuss the Ladakh disengagement processDespite the government\u2019s position that there can be no normalcy without a resolution of the LAC, the government discussed several bilateral issues with Wang- including trade, visas, Indian students, cooperation on health, and important international developments like Ukraine and AfghanistanWang invited NSA Doval to Beijing for talks of the Special Representatives on the border issues, but was told that the NSA could only look at the broader boundary resolution after the immediate issues- ie China\u2019s continued occupation of territory and troops numbers along the LAC in contravention of agreements made in 1993-96 not to change the status quoAnd External Affairs Minister Jaishankar said, that while 15 rounds of border commander level talks and 8 rounds of the Working mechanism have yielded considerable progress- several friction areas remain which must be addressed, leading to a full disengagement and de-escalation between troops.Now, while India has made all of this clear- there other troubling factors for Delhi:Wang\u2019s visit came while on a tour of South Asia- Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nepal \u2013 where he was discussing progress in the Belt and Road Initiative projects (BRI) and requested meetings in Delhi as well. This is significant since we have dealt at Worldview, India is not part of the BRI and actively opposes it.The Chinese Foreign Minister came to Delhi after attending the OIC- Organisation of Islamic Cooperation meeting in Islamabad, where his comments on Kashmir were protested by the Modi government- this cast a shadow over his visit, and was raised by EAM Jaishankar during the meeting, but it did not derail the visit. (Nor did the political turmoil in Pakistan roil the China-Pakistan relationship)Wang visited Afghanistan just before landing in Delhi, the first Foreign Minister of a P-5 nation to meet with the Taliban in Kabul including UN Designated terrorist and Taliban interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani. Significantly, his visit coincided with Russian spl envoy Kabulov, and he discussed plans for a conference of Afghanistan\u2019s land neighbours Iran, Tajikistan, China, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Pakistan in Beijing next week. India is not invited to the meeting, although NSA Doval had invited China to the Delhi meeting of Afghan neighbours last year, which his counterpart Yang Jiechi declined.Wang\u2019s visit followed 2 days after the government engaged all its partners in the Quad- summits with Japanese and Australian PM and a visit by a senior US official to India. While he didn\u2019t raise the Quad in his meetings in Delhi- China\u2019s line on the Quad, which it calls an Asian NATO, an anti-China front has been very loudly articulated in Beijing.So were there any areas of common understanding at all?The Chinese FM, by visiting Delhi, and India by hosting him have indicated that they both see a purpose in continuing high level contacts to further ties between themWhile not identical, both countries have adopted similiar votes at the UN, both abstaining in 10 votes so far, although China voted along with Russia in the 1 one prior to that. Neither are toeing the Western line and are not joining sanctions, and both have some sympathy for the Russian position. According to EAM, the common element was both called for an immediate ceasefire and both want an immediate return to dialogue and diplomacy. stBoth see upcoming summits as important prestige symbols- and while China is hopeful PM Modi will attend a BRICS, and possible RIC summit in China later this year, India will host the SCO summit and the G-20 next year, where it will want a full attendance including President Xi. Wang called these two years an Asian moment, said China doesn\u2019t seek a unipolar Asia, and respects India\u2019s traditional role in the region.There are many moving parts to the India-China relationship at present- and clearly geopolitics both in India\u2019s immediate neighbourhood and further afield were a big part of the Wang visit. But the government cannot give up its sharp focus on revolving the single biggest problem at present- and that is the presence of Chinese troops on territory India claims- and only a full demobilization and disengagement can lead to a de-escalation of that situation.Reading recommendations:Former Foreign Secretary and Ambassador to China Nirupama Rao\u2019s history of ties is a must read- filled with archives and rare insight: The Fractured Himalaya: India Tibet China 1949-62Dragon on our Doorstep: Managing China through Military Power: some fairly radical and refreshing ideas by Pravin Sawhney and Ghazala WahabThere\u2019s also a very up to date account by journalist Maroof Raza : Contested Lands: India, China and the Boundary Dispute.My colleagues at The Hindu Stanly Johny and Ananth Krishnan have a cracker of a book that is very relevant called The Comrade and The Mullahs: China, Afghanistan and the New Asian Geopolitics.And two more books with a slightly longer view:Powershift: India-China Relations in a Multipolar World by Zorawar Daulet SinghAnd India Turns East: International Engagement and US-China Rivalry by Frederic Grare"

        "text": "A Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen unleashed a barrage of airstrikes on the capital and a strategic Red Sea city, officials said Saturday. At least seven people were killed.The overnight airstrikes on Sanaa and Hodeida\u2014both held by the Houthis\u2014came a day after the rebels attacked an oil depot in the Saudi city of Jiddah, their highest-profile assault yet on the kingdom.Brig. Gen. Turki al-Malki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, said the strikes targeted \u201csources of threat\u201d to Saudi Arabia, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency.He said the coalition intercepted and destroyed two explosives-laden drones early Saturday. He said the drones were launched from Houthi-held civilian oil facilities in Hodeida, urging civilians to stay away from oil facilities in the city.Footage circulated online showed flames and plumes of smoke over Sanaa and Hodeida.  Associated Press journalists in the Yemeni capital heard loud explosions that rattled residential buildings there.The Houthis said the coalition airstrikes hit a power plant, a fuel supply station and the state-run social insurance office in the capital.A Houthi media office claimed an airstrike hit houses for guards of the social insurance office, killing at least seven people and wounding three others, including women and children.The office shared images it said showed the aftermath of the airstrike. It showed wreckage in the courtyard of a social insurance office with the shattered windows of a nearby multiple-story building.In Hodeida, the Houthi media office said the coalition hit oil facilities in violation of a 2018 cease-fire deal that ended months of fighting in Hodeida, which handles about 70% of Yemen's commercial and humanitarian imports. The strikes also hit the nearby Port Salif, also on the Red Sea.Al-Malki, the coalition spokesperson, was not immediately available for comment on the Houthi claims.The escalation is likely to complicate efforts by the U.N. special envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, to reach a humanitarian truce during the holy month of Ramadan\u201d in early April.It comes as the Gulf Cooperation Council plans to host the warring sides for talks late this month. The Houthis however have rejected Riyadh\u2014the Saudi capital where the GCC is headquartered\u2014as a venue for talks, which are expected to include an array of Yemeni factions.Yemen's brutal war erupted in 2014 after the Houthis seized Sanaa. Months later, Saudi Arabia and its allies launched a devastating air campaign to dislodge the Houthis and restore the internationally recognized government.The conflict has in recent years become a regional proxy war that has killed more than 1,50,000 people, including over 14.500 civilians. It also created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.The Houthis' Friday attack came ahead of a Formula One race in the kingdom on Sunday, raising concerns about Saudi Arabia's ability to defend itself against the Iranian-backed rebels.Friday's attack targeted the same fuel depot that the Houthis had attacked in recent days \u2014 the North Jiddah Bulk Plant that sits just southeast of the city's international airport and is a crucial hub for Muslim pilgrims heading to Mecca.In Egypt, hundreds of passengers were stranded at Cairo International Airport after their Jiddah-bound flights were canceled because of the Houthi attack, according to airport officials.The kingdom's flagship carrier Saudia announced the cancelation of two flights on its website. The two had 456 passengers booked. A third canceled flight with 146 passengers was operated by the low-cost Saudi airline Flynas.Some passengers found seats on other Saudi Arabia-bound flights and others were booked into hotels close to the Cairo airport, according to Egyptian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because there were not authorized to brief media.

        "text": "Russian forces have taken control of a town where workers at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant live, the governor of Kyiv region said on Saturday, and fighting was reported in the streets of the besieged southern port of Mariupol.After more than four weeks of conflict, Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and on Friday Moscow signalled it was scaling back its military ambitions to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists in the east.However, intense fighting was reported in a number of places on Saturday, suggesting there would be no swift let-up in the conflict, which has killed thousands of people, sent some 3.7 million abroad and driven more than half of Ukraine's children\nfrom their homes, according to the United Nations.Russian troops seized the town of Slavutych, which is close to the border with Belarus and is where workers at the Chernobyl plant live, the governor of Kyiv region, Oleksandr Pavlyuk, said.He added that the soldiers had occupied the hospital and kidnapped the mayor. Reuters could not independently verify the reports.Slavutych sits just outside the so-called exclusion zone around Chernobyl - which in 1986 was the site of the world's\nworst nuclear disaster - where Ukrainian staff have continued to work even after the plant itself was seized by Russian forces soon after the start of the Feb. 24 invasion.On the other side of the country, in Mariupol, Mayor Vadym Boichenko said the situation in the encircled city remained\ncritical, with street fighting taking place in the centre.The city has been devastated by weeks of Russian fire.In an address on Saturday to Qatar's Doha Forum, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy compared the destruction of\nMariupol to the destruction inflicted on the Syrian city of Aleppo by combined Syrian and Russian forces in the civil war.\"They are destroying our ports,\" Zelenskiy said, warning of dire consequence if his country - one of the world's major\ngrains producers - could not export its foodstuffs. \"The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries\nworldwide.\"Speaking via video link, he also called on energy producing countries to increase their output so that Russia cannot use its\nmassive oil and gas wealth to \"blackmail\" other nations. Mr. Zelenskyy late on Friday pushed for further talks with Moscow after the Russian Defence Ministry said a first phase of\nits operation was mostly complete and that it would now focus on the Donbass region bordering Russia, which has pro-Moscow separatist enclaves.Breakaway Russian-backed forces have been fighting Ukrainian forces in Donbass since 2014.Reframing Russia's goals may make it easier for President Vladimir Putin to claim a face-saving victory, analysts said.Moscow has until now said its goals for what it calls its \"special military operation\" include demilitarising and\n\"denazifying\" its neighbour. Ukraine and its Western allies have called that a baseless pretext for an unprovoked invasion.In what officials billed as a major address, U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday will underscore the West's commitment to\nsupport the people of Ukraine and hold Russia accountable for the conflict, the White House said.Biden is visiting Poland, which has taken in many of the refugees streaming out of the country.The United Nations has confirmed 1,081 civilian deaths and 1,707 injuries in Ukraine since the invasion but says the real\ntoll is likely higher. Some 136 children have been killed so far during the invasion, Ukraine's prosecutor general office said on\nSaturday.Russia's defence ministry said 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded, the Interfax news agency reported\non Friday. Ukraine says 15,000 Russian soldiers have died. Reuters could not independently verify the claims.Footage from Mariupol, home to 400,000 people before the war, showed destroyed buildings, burnt out vehicles and\nshell-shocked survivors venturing out for water and provisions. Residents have buried victims in makeshift graves as the ground thaws.Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said an agreement had been reached to set up 10 humanitarian corridors on Saturday to evacuate civilians from front line hotspots.Speaking on national television, she said civilians trying to leave Mariupol would have to travel by private cars as\nRussian forces were not letting buses through their checkpoints. Reuters could not independently verify this information.More than 100,000 people still need to be evacuated from the Mariupol, Vereshchuk said.To the north, battle lines near the capital Kyiv have been frozen for weeks with two main Russian armoured columns stuck\nnorthwest and east of the city.A British intelligence report on Saturday said Russian forces were relying on indiscriminate air and artillery\nbombardments rather than risk large-scale ground operations.\"It is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already\nconsiderable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties,\" the latest British assessment said."

        "text": "Yemen's Houthi rebels attacked an oil depot on Friday in the Saudi city of Jiddah ahead of a Formula One race in the kingdom. It was the rebels' highest-profile assault yet, though Saudi authorities pledged the upcoming grand prix would go on as scheduled. The attack targeted the same fuel depot that the Houthis had attacked in recent days, the North Jiddah Bulk Plant that sits just southeast of the city's international airport and is a crucial hub for Muslim pilgrims heading to Mecca. No injuries were reported in the attack. The Saudi Arabian Oil Co, known as Saudi Aramco, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Saudi authorities acknowledged a \u201chostile operation\u201d by the Houthis targeting the depot with a missile. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia leads a coalition battling the Iran-backed Houthis, who seized Yemen's capital of Sanaa in September 2014. The kingdom, which entered the war in 2015, has been internationally criticized for its airstrikes killing that have killed scores of civilians - something the Houthis point to as they launch drones, missiles and mortars into the kingdom. Brig Gen Turki al-Malki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition, said the fire damaged two tanks and was put out without injuries. \"This hostile escalation targets oil facilities and aims to undermine energy security and the backbone of global economy,\" Mr. al-Malki said, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency. \u201cThese hostile attacks had no impact or repercussions in any way, shape or form on public life in Jiddah.\u201d  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the Houthi attacks on Twitter. \u201cThese strikes put civilian lives at risk and must stop,\u201d he wrote. An Associated Press photojournalist covering practice laps at the F1 track in Jiddah saw the smoke rising in the distance to the east, just after 5:40 p.m. (local time). As the flames rose, the tops of the tanks of the bulk plant were clearly visible some 11.5 kms away. Drivers raced on into the evening even as the fire burned. The second-ever Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in Jiddah is taking place on Sunday, though concerns had been raised by some over the recent attacks targeting the kingdom. Hours later, the F1 said plans for Saturday's third practice and qualifying and Sunday's race were still set to go ahead. The Saudi Motorsport Co, which promotes the race, acknowledged the attack but said the \u201crace weekend schedule will continue as planned.\u201d We \u201cremain in direct contact with Saudi security authorities, as well as F1 and the FIA to ensure all necessary security and safety measures,\u201d the company said, referring to motorsport's governing body. \u201cThe safety and security of all our guests continues to be our main priority.\"  The al-Masirah satellite news channel run by Yemen's Houthi rebels later claimed they had attacked an Aramco facility in Jiddah, along with other targets in Riyadh and elsewhere. Meanwhile, Saudi State TV also acknowledged attacks in one town targeting water tanks that damaged vehicles and homes. Another attack targeted an electrical substation in an area of southwestern Saudi Arabia near the Yemeni border, State TV said. The North Jiddah Bulk Plant stores diesel, gasoline and jet fuel for use in Jiddah, the kingdom's second-largest city. It accounts for over a quarter of all of Saudi Arabia's supplies and also supplies fuel crucial to running a regional desalination plant. The Houthis have twice targeted the North Jiddah plant with cruise missiles. One attack came in November 2020. The last came on Sunday as part of a wider barrage by the Houthis. At the time of the 2020 attack, the targeted tank, which has a capacity of 500,000 barrels, held diesel fuel, according to a recent report by a UN panel of experts examining Yemen's war. Repairing it after the last attack cost Aramco some $1.5 million. The United Nations experts described the facility as a \u201ccivilian target,\u201d which the Houthis should have avoided after the 2020 attack. \u201cWhile the facility also supplies the Saudi military with petroleum products, it is mostly supplying civilian customers,\u201d the panel said. \u201cIf the plant had been out of service of a significant period, the impact on the kingdom's economy as well as on the welfare of the residents of the Western region would likely have been significant.\u201d  Cruise missiles and drones remain difficult to defend against, though the United States recently sent a significant number of Patriot anti-missile interceptors to Saudi Arabia to resupply the kingdom amid the Houthi attacks. In September, the AP reported that the U.S. had removed its own Patriot and THAAD defence systems from Prince Sultan Air Base outside of Riyadh. The attacks have renewed questions about the kingdom's ability to defend itself from Houthi fire as a yearslong war in the Arab world's poorest country rages on with no end in sight. It also comes as Saudi Arabia issued an unusually stark warning that it is unable to guarantee its oil production won't be affected by further attacks - which could push global energy prices even higher amid Russia's war on Ukraine. Benchmark Brent crude prices briefly rose above $120 a barrel in trading on Friday. "

Max Schrems, an Austrian activist and lawyer, has spearheaded the legal onslaught and on Friday dismissed the \"political announcement\" by Biden and Von der Leyen that would likely fail in court.Once the text lands, \"if it is not in line with EU law, we or another group will likely challenge it,\" Mr. Schrems warned.The previous deal, known as Privacy Shield, was struck down in 2020 and was the successor to another EU-U.S. deal, Safe Harbour, which was itself torpedoed by a similar court ruling in 2015.Businesses have since resorted to legally uncertain workarounds to keep the data flow moving, with hope that the two sides could come up with something stronger in the long term.Mr. Schrems has attacked these short-term solutions and his Austrian data privacy group NOYB (none of your business) has filed dozens of complaints against Google across Europe"

        "text": "COLOMBOThe Sri Lankan government will set up a \u2018North-East Development Fund\u2019 to increase investments in the war-affected areas, while probing cases of enforced disappearances and land grabs that remain chief concerns of the Tamil people 13 years after the war ended. The announcement came on Friday, after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa met a delegation of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the largest grouping of parliamentarians representing districts in the north and east. It was Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s first meeting with the country\u2019s Tamil political leadership since his election to office in November 2019. \u00a0The meeting took place for over two hours at the Presidential Secretariat, with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, his older brother and Irrigation Minister Chamal Rajapaksa, also present. The TNA has been demanding that the government deliver the long-pending political solution to Sri Lanka\u2019s national question, through a new constitutional settlement. The demand was the thrust of TNA leader and veteran Tamil politician R. Sampanthan\u2019s letter to President Rajapaksa ahead of the meeting, twice postponed before it was held on Friday. But the government sought to postpone the discussion on the political solution, as an experts\u2019 committee report on constitutional proposals is expected to be made public within two months\u2019 time, according to TNA spokesman and Jaffna legislator M.A. Sumanthiran. \u00a0The President meanwhile agreed to focus on four key areas, including possibly releasing long-term detainees under the country\u2019s draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) -- which the government recently amended but critics want repealed \u2013 and suspects held without being charged; ending the incessant land grabs in the north and east by different state agencies to allegedly change the demographics of the region; inquiring into cases of enforced disappearances and establishing a special development fund for the north and east, he said. Families of disappeared persons, mainly women, have been protesting for years now, demanding the truth about their loved ones who went missing, or surrendered to the military during the civil war years or soon after. Mr. Gotabaya, who was Secretary to the Ministry of Defence during those years, has denied there were enforced disappearances then. \u00a0At Friday\u2019s discussion, the President told the TNA that his government was working on \u201ca number of issues\u201d, including the release of suspects held in long-term detention, and those who have not been charged or prosecuted, the launch of \u201ca truth-finding\u201d mechanism, the amendment of the PTA and resolving \u201cissues related to missing persons\u201d, a statement from his office said. President Gotabaya has in the past emphasised development over devolution, as the most important need for the war-affected areas. The initiative to set up a development fund exclusively for the war-affected areas comes nearly three years after his election, amid widespread joblessness, indebtedness, and poverty in the region that the pandemic and Sri Lanka\u2019s current economic crisis have only aggravated. Earlier this week 16 people from northern Sri Lanka fled the country\u2019s current economic crisis, and sought refuge in Tamil Nadu. Ground Zero: In Sri Lanka, yet another chance at post-war recoveryMeanwhile, in a recent All Party Conference convened by the President on the economic crisis, TNA Leader Mr. Sampanthan spoke of the need to urgently address the Tamil question. The long civil war pulled the country and its economy down by decades, and the reasons for the war remain unresolved, with the Tamil people still denied their right to equality and dignity, he had observed. \u201cWe are willing to work with the government to solve this economic crisis, but we must remember that without a decisive political solution, we will not be able to revive our country\u2019s economy,\u201d he had said.Commenting on the TNA\u2019s opinion of Friday\u2019s meeting with the President, spokesman Mr. Sumanthiran told The Hindu: \u201cThe success of today\u2019s meeting will depend on the government\u2019s prompt action on the issues they have agreed to address."

        "text": "China's state-run Sinopec Group has suspended talks for a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia, sources told Reuters, heeding a government call for caution as sanctions mount over the invasion of Ukraine.The move by Asia's biggest oil refiner to hit the brakes on a potentially half-billion-dollar investment in a gas chemical plant and a venture to market Russian gas in China highlights the risks, even to Russia's most important diplomatic partner, of unexpectedly heavy Western-led sanctions.Beijing has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions, insisting it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with Russia, and has refused to condemn Moscow's actions in Ukraine or call them an invasion.But behind the scenes, the government is wary of Chinese companies running afoul of sanctions - it is pressing companies to tread carefully with investments in Russia, its second-largest oil supplier and third-largest gas provider.Since Russia invaded a month ago, China's three state energy giants - Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) - have been assessing the impact of the sanctions on their multibillion dollar investments in Russia, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.\"Companies will rigidly follow Beijing's foreign policy in this crisis,\" said an executive at a state oil company. \"There's no room whatsoever for companies to take any initiatives in terms of new investment.\"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs this month summoned officials from the three energy companies to review their business ties with Russian partners and local operations, two sources with knowledge of the meeting said. One said the ministry urged them not to make any rash moves buying Russian assets.The companies have set up task forces on Russia-related matters and are working on contingency plans for business disruptions and in case of secondary sanctions, sources said.The sources asked not to be named, given the sensitivity of the matter. Sinopec and the other companies declined to comment.The ministry said there is no need for China to report to other parties about \"whether there are internal meetings or not\".\"China is a big, independent country. We have the right to carry out normal economic and trade cooperation in various fields with other countries across the world,\" it said in a faxed statement.U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that China knows its economic future is tied to the West, after warning Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Beijing could regret siding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Global oil majors Shell and BP, and Norway's Equinor pledged to exit their Russian operations shortly after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Moscow says its \"special operation\" aims not to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists.Sinopec, formally China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, has\nsuspended the discussions to invest up to $500 million in the\nnew gas chemical plant in Russia, one of the sources said.The plan has been to team up with Sibur, Russia's largest\npetrochemical producer, for a project similar to the $10 billion\nAmur Gas Chemical Complex in East Siberia, 40% owned by Sinopec\nand 60% by Sibur, set to come online in 2024.\"The companies wanted to replicate the Amur venture by\nbuilding another one and were in the middle of site selection,\"\nsaid the source.Sinopec hit pause after realising that Sibur minority\nshareholder and board member Gennady Timchenko had been\nsanctioned by the West, the source said. The European Union and\nBritain last month imposed sanctions on Timchenko, a long-time\nally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and other billionaires\nwith ties to Putin.Mr. Timchenko's spokesman declined to comment on sanctions.The Amur project itself faces funding snags, said two of the\nsources, as sanctions threaten to choke financing from key\nlenders, including Russia's state-controlled Sberbank\nand European credit agencies.\"It's an existing investment. Sinopec is trying to overcome\nthe difficulties in financing,\" said a Beijing-based industry\nexecutive with direct knowledge of the matter.Sibur did not comment on the suspension of the talks for the\nnew chemical plant but said it continues to cooperate with\nSinopec. It said the two companies continue to work jointly on\nimplementing the Amur plant.\"Sinopec is actively participating in the issues of the\nproject's construction management, including equipment supplies,\nwork with suppliers and contractors. We are also jointly working\non the issues of project financing,\" Sibur told Reuters by\nemail.Sinopec also suspended talks over the gas marketing venture\nwith Russian gas producer Novatek over concerns that\nSberbank, one of Novatek's shareholders, is on the latest U.S.\nsanctions list, said one source with direct knowledge of the\nmatter.Mr. Timchenko resigned from Novatek's board on Monday in the\nwake of the sanctions. Novatek declined to comment.Novatek, Russia's largest independent gas producer, entered\na preliminary deal in 2019 with Sinopec and Gazprombank to\ncreate a joint venture marketing liquefied natural gas to China\nas well as distributing natural gas in China.Beyond Sinopec's planned Amur plant, CNPC and CNOOC were\namong the latest investors into Russia's natural gas sector,\ntaking minority stakes in major export project Arctic LNG 2 in\n2019 and Yamal LNG in 2014."

        "title": "\nUkraine reports 300 died in Russian airstrike on Mariupol theatre\n",
        "text": "Ukrainian authorities said Friday that about 300 people died when a Russian airstrike blew up a theater where hundreds of civilians were sheltering \u2014 a catastrophic loss of civilian life that, if confirmed, is likely to further crank up pressure on Western nations to step up military aid.In a vain attempt to protect those inside from missile and airstrikes that Russia has rained down on cities, an enormous inscription reading \u201cCHILDREN\u201d in Russian had been posted outside the grand, columned theater to make it visible from the air.For days, the government in the besieged ruins of Mariupol was unable to give a casualty count for the March 16 attack. The post on its Telegram channel Friday cited eyewitnesses, but it was not immediately clear whether emergency workers had finished excavating the theater ruins or how witnesses arrived at the horrific figure of lives lost. Still, the emerging picture of gruesome casualties could refocus attention on the refusal thus far of countries from the NATO alliance to supply warplanes or fly patrols to protect Ukraine's airspace, despite repeated pleas from the country's embattled president.The scale of devastation in Mariupol, where bodies have laid unburied amid bomb craters and buildings have been hollowed out by relentless attacks, have made information difficult to obtain. But soon after the attack, the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s human rights commissioner said more than 1,300 people had taken cover in the theater, many of them because their homes were destroyed in Russia's siege. The building had a basement bomb shelter, and some survivors did emerge from the rubble after the attack. The new reported death toll came a day after U.S. President Joe Biden and allied leaders promised that more military aid for Ukraine was coming. But they stopped short of providing the heavy weaponry that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said is urgently needed. NATO nations fear that providing planes, tanks and the no-fly zone in Ukraine's airspace could increase the risk of them being drawn into direct conflict with Russia.The U.S. and the European Union on Friday did announce a move to further squeeze Russia economically: a partnership to reduce Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian energy and slowly dry up the billions of dollars the Kremlin gets from sales of fossil fuels. Even without a direct conflict between Russian and NATO forces, Europe\u2019s most serious security crisis since World War II pushed relations toward breaking point. The Kremlin is bristling at the tightening noose of sanctions around Russia's economy, currency and business leaders accused of being supportive of President Vladimir Putin. His foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, on Friday characterized the Western pressure as \u201ca real hybrid war, total war.\u201d \u201cAnd the goals are not hidden,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey are declared publicly \u2014 to destroy, break, annihilate, strangle the Russian economy, and Russia on the whole.\u201dIn Ukrainian towns and cities that day-by-day increasingly resemble the ruins that Russian forces left behind in previous campaigns in Syria and Chechnya, the misery for civilians grows ever more acute.Those who can are trying to flee, emptying out their cities. In relentlessly shelled Kharkiv, mostly elderly women came to collect food and other urgent supplies. In the capital of Kyiv, ashes of the dead are piling up at the main crematorium because so many relatives have left, leaving urns unclaimed.Meanwhile, the vulnerable \u2014 the elderly, children and others unable to join millions heading westward \u2014 face food shortages in a country once known as the breadbasket for the world.Fidgeting with anticipation, a young girl in Kharkiv watched intently this week as a volunteer\u2019s knife cut through a giant slab of cheese, carving out thick slices \u2014 one for each hungry person waiting stoically in line.Hanna Spitsyna took charge of divvying up the delivery of food aid from the Ukrainian Red Cross, handing it out to her neighbors. Each got a lump of the cheese that was cut under the child's watchful gaze, dropped chunk by chunk into plastic bags that people in line held open like hungry mouths. \u201cThey brought us aid, brought us aid for the elderly women that stayed here,\" Spitsyna said. \u201cAll these people need diapers, swaddle blankets and food.\" Unable to sweep with lightning-quick speed into Kyiv, the apparent aim on Feb. 24 when the Kremlin launched the war, Russian forces are instead raining down shells and missiles on cities from afar. Kyiv, like other cities, has seen its population dramatically reduced in the vast refugee crisis that has seen more than 10 million displaced, including at least 3.5 million who have fled the country entirely.Russia\u2019s military claimed Friday that it destroyed a massive Ukrainian fuel base used to supply the Kyiv region\u2019s defenses, with ships firing a salvo of cruise missiles, according to the Interfax news agency. Videos on social media showed an enormous fireball explosion near the capital. The outskirts of Kharkiv were shrouded by foggy smoke Friday, with shelling constant since early in the morning. In a city hospital, several wounded soldiers arrived, with bullet and shrapnel wounds, a day after doctors treated a dozen civilians. Even as doctors stabilized the direst case, the sound of shelling could be heard in the surgery ward. At an emergency NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday, Zelenskyy pleaded with the Western allies via video for planes, tanks, rockets, air defense systems and other weapons, saying his country is \u201cdefending our common values.\u201dThe invasion has sharpened an energy and moral dilemma for European nations that heat homes and power industries with Russian fossil fuels. Alarmed that the billions they pay can be channeled by the Kremlin toward its war effort, they\u2019re speeding up hunts for alternatives.Germany said Friday that it has forged contracts with new suppliers that will significantly reduce its reliance on Russian coal, gas and oil in coming weeks. Biden said the new U.S.-EU gas-supply partnership will help undercut Putin's use of energy sales to \u201ccoerce and manipulate his neighbors\u201d and \u201cdrive his war machine.\u201d Under the plan, the U.S. and other nations will increase liquified natural gas exports to Europe by 15 billion cubic meters this year.While millions of Ukrainians have fled west, Ukraine accused Moscow of forcibly removing hundreds of thousands of civilians from shattered cities to Russia to pressure Kyiv to give up. Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine\u2019s ombudsperson, said 402,000 people, including 84,000 children, had been taken against their will into Russia, where some may be used as \u201chostages\u201d to pressure Kyiv to surrender. The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated, but said they were from predominantly Russian-speaking regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine and wanted to go to Russia. Pro-Moscow separatists have been fighting for control for nearly eight years in those regions, where many people have supported close ties to Russia.\u2014In Chernihiv, where an airstrike this week destroyed a crucial bridge, a city official, Olexander Lomako, said a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d is unfolding as Russian forces target food storage places. He said about 130,000 people are left in the besieged city, about half its prewar population.\u2014Russia said it will offer safe passage starting Friday to 67 ships from 15 foreign countries that are stranded in Ukrainian ports because of the danger of shelling and mines.\u2014 The International Atomic Energy Agency said it has been told by Ukrainian authorities that Russian shelling is preventing worker rotations in and out of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. It said Russian forces have shelled Ukrainian checkpoints in the city of Slavutych, home to many Chernobyl nuclear workers, \u201cputting them at risk and preventing further rotation of personnel to and from the site.\u201d"

        "title": "\nU.S., European Union announce new partnership to undercut Russian energy\n",
        "text": "The United States and European Union on March 25 announced a new partnership to reduce the continent's reliance on Russian energy, a step that top officials characterised as the start of a years-long initiative to further isolate Moscow after its invasion of Ukraine. U. S. President Joe Biden asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin uses energy to \u201ccoerce and manipulate his neighbours\u201d and uses the profits from its sale to \u201cdrive his war machine.\u201d Mr. Biden said the partnership he announced jointly with a top European Union official will turn that dynamic on its head by reducing Europe's dependence on Russian energy sources, as well reducing the continent's demand for gas overall.The President said such a step is not \u201conly the right thing to do from a moral standpoint\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s going to put us on a stronger strategic footing.\u201d Under the plan, the U. S. and other nations will increase liquified natural gas exports to Europe by 15 billion cubic meters this year, though U. S. officials were unable to say exactly which countries will provide the extra energy this year. Even larger shipments would be delivered in the future. At the same time, they will try to keep their climate goals on track by powering gas infrastructure with clean energy and reducing methane leaks that can worsen global warming. \u201cAlthough the initiative will likely require new facilities for importing liquified natural gas, the partnership is also geared toward reducing reliance on fossil fuels in the long run through energy efficiency and alternative sources of energy,\u201d according to the White House.Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU's executive arm, said it is important for Europe to shift away from Russia and toward energy suppliers that are trustworthy, friendly and reliable. \u201cWe aim to reduce this dependence on Russian fossil fuels and get rid of it,\" she said.Russian energy is a key source of income and political leverage for Moscow. Almost 40% of the European Union's natural gas comes from Russia to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry. Mr. Biden was leaving Brussels after the announcement and heading to Rzesz\u00f3w in Poland, where U. S. troops are based roughly an hour's drive from the Ukrainian border. He will be briefed on the humanitarian response to the refugees streaming out of Ukraine and those still suffering inside the country. He also will meet with U. S. service members from the 82nd Airborne Division, who serve alongside Polish troops.Mr. Biden is then expected to fly to Warsaw for talks Saturday with Polish President Andrzej Duda and an address to the Polish people before he departs for Washington.While in Brussels, Mr. Biden participated in a trio of summits hosted by NATO, the Group of Seven industrialised nations and the European Union, all on Thursday. The extraordinary series of meetings reflects heightened concerns about the war in Ukraine, which has entered its second month.Although Ukraine has resisted the Russian invasion much more successfully than initially expected, the conflict has become a grueling and bloody affair, with thousands of casualties on each side and millions of refugees fleeing the country. Western leaders are also concerned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could use chemical or even nuclear weapons to regain momentum in the war. Getting more liquefied natural gas to Europe could be difficult, even though the U.S. has been dramatically increasing its exports in recent years. Many export facilities are already operating at capacity, and most new terminals are still only in the planning stages. Most U. S. shipments already go to Europe, according to the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, an industry lobbying group. Although much of the supply is already contracted out to buyers, there are still opportunities to shift its destination.\u201cThe U. S. is in a unique position because it has flexible LNG that can be rerouted to Europe or to Asia, depending on who\u2019s willing to pay that price,\u201d said Emily McClain, gas markets analyst at Rystad. Even if the U. S. can ship more gas to Europe, the continent may struggle to receive it. Import terminals are located in coastal areas, where there are fewer pipeline connections for distributing it. And if all Europe\u2019s facilities were operating at capacity, the amount of gas would likely be only about two-thirds of what Russia delivers through pipelines."

        "title": "\nExplained | Why has Putin\u2019s advisor Anatoly Chubais quit and left Russia?\n",
        "text": "Story so far: Anatoly Chubais, the architect of Russia\u2019s post-Soviet economic reforms, is the most senior official to resign since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As per reports, he has fled the country and is currently in Turkey with his wife. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told RIA Novosti state agency that Chubais resigned \u201caccording to his own desire\u201d but, did not confirm if he had left the country. According to sources cited by Reuters, Chubais does not intend to return to Russia. Let\u2019s take a look at who Chubais is, the influence he holds and what his resignation means for Russia.After the fall of the Soviet Union, the 66-year-old economist became known for his crucial role in helping reform Russia\u2019s economy in the 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin. He was also responsible for a privatisation drive that created a large number of very wealthy oligarchs.It was Chubais who gave Putin his first job at the Kremlin in the mid-1990s. Under Putin\u2019s presidency, Chubais held several senior business and political profiles before being selected Kremlin\u2019s special envoy to international organisations. He was in charge of \u201cachieving goals of sustainable development\u201d in 2020, days after resigning as the head of Rusnano, a firm established by the Russian state to develop nano technology. Indicating his unhappiness over the situation in Ukraine, Chubais on March 19 shared a picture of Yegor Gaidar, a fellow liberal reformer who passed away in 2009. In his Facebook post, he wrote that Gaidar, a well-known critic of the Putin regime, \u201cunderstood the strategic risks better than I did, and I was wrong.\u201dIn his 2006 book, Death of Empire, Gaidar warned of the temptations of imperial nostalgia for the Soviet Union he saw growing under Putin. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to convince society that a state that collapsed so suddenly can be just as quickly rebuilt. That\u2019s an illusion, a dangerous one,\u201d he wrote. In what was seen as a critical gesture against the Kremlin, Chubais had also posted a picture of opposition figure, Boris Nemstov, who was murdered outside the Kremlin walls in 2015. No caption was attached to this Facebook post. He is also yet to comment on his resignation. However, opposition leaders were unmoved by Chubais\u2019 resignation. Rubbishing claims that his decision was an anti-war protest, Kira Yarmysh, spokesperson of the jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny, said it was \u201cout of fear for his own skin and his own money.\u201dFormer Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich last week stepped down as chair of state-backed Skolkovo Foundation, citing his opposition to the war in Ukraine. \u201cWars are the worst things one might face in life\u2026including this war. My thoughts are with Ukrainian civilians,\u201d Dvorkovich told US magazine Mother Jones.Chubais\u2019 resignation is already creating a buzz in Russia, where he is a well-known figure.A Western official told Reutersthat Chubais\u2019 move was encouraging but is unlikely to shake Putin\u2019s firm grip on power. \u201cI think it\u2019s encouraging that there are senior Russian members of the political class that are doing such things, but it doesn\u2019t undermine the security of Putin and his regime, given his iron grip,\u201d the official said, on condition of anonymity.According to BBC, other than Peshov and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, few members of the President\u2019s inner circle have appeared in public in recent weeks. Ukrainian presidential adviser on Wednesday pointed out that the two top security leaders, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, were \u201cnowhere to be seen\u201d along with the heads of Russia\u2019s secret services.\rSeveral media professionals have also resigned, including Channel One editor Marina Ovsyannikova, who held up a poster saying \u201cStop the War!\u201d during a prime-time news broadcast.In a bid to clamp down on criticism of the invasion in Ukraine, which began on February 24, Russia asked the state-run media to describe it as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. Since then, Ukraine has been bombed several times by the Russian military, leading to massive destruction and casualties. "

Moscow claimed it was the largest remaining military fuel storage facility in Ukraine, saying it supplied troops in the central part of the pro-Western country. Ukraine confirmed the strike, saying it had hit around 8 pm (0600 GMT) in the village some 40 kilometres south-west of Kyiv.

        "text": "The story so far: Many Asian and European nations are witnessing a surge in the number of coronavirus cases, largely driven by the Omicron variant and its sub-variant BA.2. According to Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation (WHO) director for Europe, the increase in cases has come after European countries \u201cbrutally eased restrictions\u201d, news agencies reported. Here\u2019s a look at the current Covid-19 hotspots around the world. China has imposed its fifth localised lockdown in the last two weeks to tackle the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country. Tangshan City, a steel hub in Hebei province, has been put under a full temporary lockdown, according to local authorities. Residents have been asked to not leave their homes or buildings except for tests or emergencies, the government has said. Rumours of financial hub Shanghai being put under a lockdown were dismissed by the government. Like many other European nations, the U.K. is also experiencing a surge in coronavirus infections after most restrictions were lifted. The daily growth of Covid-19 infections in England has increased to +2% to +6% compared to an estimated range of between -2% to +2%, last week, news agency Reuters reported. In Scotland, government figures reveal that 2,257 people were in the hospital on Tuesday with recently confirmed Covid-19. This is the highest number of patients ever recorded in the hospital on a single day since the beginning of the pandemic. Britain observed a minute-long silence on Wednesday to remember the victims of the pandemic on the second anniversary of the first lockdown in the country. South Korea has been overwhelmed by an exponential increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the country. The country has reported over ten million cases overall, and almost three million of these were registered in the last seven days, according to the latest figures provided by the WHO. The record Covid-19 wave is being driven by the Omicron variant of the virus. The death toll in South Korea has nearly doubled in just about six weeks, increasing demand for funeral arrangements, news agency Reuters reported. In Seoul, 28 crematories were operating at 114.2% capacity as of Monday. The health ministry has instructed nationwide crematories to operate for longer hours. Germany has decided to go ahead with the scheduled easing of Covid-19 restrictions despite facing a surge in infections driven by the Omicron variant. The country has recorded more than 1.5 million new cases in the last seven days, according to the data provided by the WHO. The total number of infections in Germany since the beginning of the pandemic stands at over 19 million. France has recorded its biggest jump in the number of Covid-19 cases since February. Hospital numbers rose for the third straight day, and 180,777 new infections were recorded on Tuesday, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. France now has over 34 million registered Covid-19 infections overall.Italy was one of the worst-affected countries when the Covid-19 pandemic began, and has now recorded the third-highest cumulative death toll in Europe after Russia and the U.K. According to the data provided by the WHO, the country has recorded more than half a million new coronavirus cases in the last seven days -- the fourth-highest figure in Europe after Germany, France, and the U.K. BA.2 is a subvariant of Omicron strain that has been classified as a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d by the WHO. BA.2 differs from BA.1 in its genetic sequence, including some amino acid differences in the spike protein and other proteins. The subvariant has also been called \u201cstealth omicron\u201d since it is not easy to detect. The BA.2 subvariant is inherently more transmissible than BA.1, the WHO has said.

Earlier this week, the country\u2019s Education Department postponed term examinations for millions of students, as they did not have sufficient paper. Authorities also said they could not complete printing textbooks for the new term amid persisting shortage of paper. And now, the country\u2019s print media is the latest victim of the crippling economic crisis. \u201cWe are not printing the Saturday edition alone, as a temporary measure. The situation is very grim,\u201d The Island\u2019s Editor Prabath Sahabandu told The Hindu. \u201cMany Sri Lankan newspapers have been going slimmer lately. We are all forced to cut down our pages and give truncated news because it\u2019s not just newsprint that we import, but also printing plates and ink. And everything is either in short supply or just not available,\u201d he said. Fewer pages, in turn, lead to lesser advertisement revenue for the publications, editors pointed out. With printing having become a challenge, they also fear that crucial coverage of the current crisis may not reach the public if the newsprint shortage continues. Since its launch in 1981, The Island has shut its press only for the annual Sinhala-Tamil New Year holidays in April. \u201cWe never stopped printing even during the war. It was only during the lockdowns during the pandemic that we had to suspend the print edition because distribution was not possible,\u201d Mr. Sahabandu said. \u00a0According to him, the government printer has indicated that they will run out of paper in two months. \u201cThey are worried about how gazettes and other vital official documents will be printed.\u201d Most Sri Lankan newspapers use newsprint from Norway, Australia, Indonesia, and Russia to print their pages. The country\u2019s dollar crunch has led to imports of even essentials being delayed or stalled, due to the uncertainty in dollar payments. Meanwhile the Sri Lankan rupee has plummeted to nearly 285 (official buying rate) against a US dollar. \u201cWhen we placed an order for newsprint about three months ago, it was $ 750 a ton, and now it has gone up to $ 1070 per ton. About 70 % of our production costs are for newsprint. We are now forced to import newsprint from India, despite its poor quality,\u201d said Kumar Nadesan, Managing Director at Express Newspapers (Ceylon)Limited, which publishes Tamil daily Virakesari. \u00a0\u201cIt is becoming very difficult to sustain the news business in this situation. \u00a0We must pay our staff. We can\u2019t ask them to work from home because of the power cuts across the country. In fact, we must give them some sort of a hardship allowance to cope with this crisis,\u201d said Mr. Nadesan, who is also the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Press Institute. "

Several prominent opposition members, including Leader of the Opposition in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan Peoples\u2019 Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and co-chair Asif Ali Zardari were in the Parliament House on Friday to participate in the much-anticipated session. As Speaker Qaiser adjourned the session, Opposition leaders started protesting, requesting him to take up the motion but the Speaker did not turn their microphones on and retired to his chamber. The Speaker said that the decision on taking up the no-confidence motion would be taken in the next session. The voting on the resolution should be held at least three to seven days after it has been laid before the National Assembly, according to rules. The National Assembly Secretariat had on Thursday issued a 15-point \u2018Orders of the Day\u2019 for the NA session, which included the no-confidence resolution. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Khawaja Asif tweeted that out of 163 opposition lawmakers, 159 were present in the house. It was not clear how many ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party lawmakers attended the session. Addressing a press conference outside Parliament House shortly after the session was adjourned, PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif warned that if the no-confidence motion was not allowed to move on Monday, then they would not be responsible for what would come next. \"Asad Qaiser acted as a PTI worker instead of the National Assembly speaker,\u201d he said, adding that the opposition would resort to legal and constitutional protests if Qaiser tried to \"act as a slave (of Khan)\". He also called for the speaker to be tried under Article 6 of the Constitution, which deals with high treason. \"The no-trust motion is going to be our democratic weapon. We will move towards free and fair elections,\" Bilawal said, adding that the prime minister had lost \"his majority and government\". Reacting to Sharif's comments, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi demanded an apology from him for his tirade against the speaker. \"The words you have used against Asad Qaiser are inappropriate and I want you to retract the remarks immediately,\" he said. Qureshi also refuted claims that the government was \"running away\" from the no-confidence motion. \"We will deal with it in a democratic, political, and legal way.\" Earlier, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry tried to make light of the proceedings in the assembly by saying: \"Nothing else will take place in the assembly session; everything will happen in Gaddafi Stadium.\" He was apparently referring to the final day of the 3rd Test between Pakistan and Australia. Pakistan has been on the edge since Opposition parties on March 8 submitted a no-confidence motion before the National Assembly Secretariat, alleging that the government led by Prime Minister Khan was responsible for the economic crisis and the spiralling inflation in the country. Khan, 69, is heading a coalition government and he can be removed if some of the partners decide to switch sides. He is facing a rebellion by his about two dozen lawmakers and allied parties which are also reluctant to pledge support to him. Both Mr. Khan and his ministers are trying to give the impression that everything was fine and he would come out victorious out of the trial. No Pakistani Prime Minister has ever completed a full five-year term in office. Ringing the alarm bells, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid said on Thursday that early elections can be held in the country to end the current political uncertainty. The next general election is due by late 2023. On Wednesday, Khan had said that he will not resign at any cost and claimed to have a \"surprise\" up his sleeve for the opposition, even as at least three allies of the ruling coalition have indicated to vote against his government during the no-trust motion. Both government and opposition politicians have been working overtime to tilt the balance in their favour. On Thursday, Pakistan's Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial said that discarding lawmakers' vote during the no-confidence motion against the prime minister would be \"insulting\" and a member of the National Assembly cannot be barred from voting. Chief Justice Bandial is heading a five-member larger bench of the apex court to hear a petition by the government to seek guidance from the Supreme Court about the allowing a dissident to vote against party policy and the length of disqualification for going against the party line while voting in the parliament. The legal battle is part of the political war going between Prime Minister Khan and opposition parties. The PTI has 155 members in the 342-member National Assembly and needs at least 172 lawmakers on its side to remain in the government. On Thursday, Prime Minister Khan invited the nation to participate in the ruling party's March 27 power show at Islamabad's Parade Ground, calling on the people to join him in \"standing against evil\".

        "text": "Russia has been at war with Ukraine since February 24th 2022. Visuals of completely destroyed cities and stranded citizens are being shared on the news and on social media, with a growing call to stop the violence. To guard the rights and lives of the innocent and wounded, the world is increasingly looking to the Geneva Convention guidelinesThe Geneva Conventions are a set of four treaties. They were established as a result of the second World War. They were formalised in 1949, and three protocols, the first two in 1977 and the third in 2005 were added. These laws of war codify ethical and legal international standards for humanitarian treatment of those impacted by any ongoing war.In the current conflict, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his administration have firmly denied any harm to civilians. But with several videos and photos showing civilian casualties, damaged hospitals and other public property mounting, leaders across the world are looking to the Geneva Conventions.  The violation of the conventions and committal of war crimes can be investigated and prosecuted by the International Criminal Court. But analysts say the evidence doesn\u2019t answer the most important question in any war-crime prosecution - who ordered which crime?  The only proof, if recoverable, is in the Russian soldiers\u2019 phones and devices. The evidence can be orders from commanding officers or even visuals of these war crimes being committed. To look into this further, the ICC opened a war crimes investigation under its prosecutor, Karim Khan on February 28th 2022.  While all 196 countries comply with the Geneva conventions, in 2019, Russia withdrew itself from Article 90 of protocol 1. This article expects the country to oblige and comply with any international fact-finding mission. Russia\u2019s pre-emptive withdrawal will enable them to refuse access to records or resources that can hold Moscow responsible for the breach of the Geneva Conventions."

        "text": "Candidates for Philippine congressional seats and thousands of smaller races started campaigning on March 25 with police watching closely due to past violence and to enforce a pandemic ban on handshakes, hugging and tightly packed crowds that are a hallmark of the country\u2019s often circus-like campaigns. Campaigning for the Presidency and other high-profile races began last month. Nearly 66 million Filipinos in the country and more than 1.6 million abroad have registered to vote in the May 9 elections for more than 18,000 local government and congressional posts.Social media has become a key battleground for votes after two years of lockdowns and home quarantine restrictions in a Southeast Asian country that was hit hard by coronavirus outbreaks. The last alarming spike occurred in January before easing with an intensified vaccination campaign. Many fear election disinformation could worsen in a country regarded as one of the world's top internet users.In the capital Manila, a Mayoral candidate launched her candidacy by waving and dancing from a pickup truck that weaved through a crowded public market area and blared her campaign jingle as crowds cheered from the sidewalks and snapped photos with their cellphones. Her mascot waved to the crowd from another truck in a scene shown live on Facebook. In suburban Marikina city, a Mayoral candidate walked from house to house under the intense summer heat and talked to residents as followers trailed him, including one who banged a snare drum to draw attention. In Quezon city, also in the Manila metropolis, red and white confetti rained down on a stage, as the Mayor, who is seeking reelection, and her allies held and raised each other's hands in a show of unity. She later approached supporters, some of whom grabbed her hands. Such fiesta-like scenes were replicated in most of the country.Some candidates openly flouted elections coronavirus regulations, campaigning in public without the required face masks, shaking hands and huddling close to supporters seeking selfies. Elections Commissioner George Garcia warned candidates not to violate coronavirus restrictions. \u201cWhile we have eased restrictions, it doesn\u2019t mean there can be super-spreader events,\u201d he said in a news conference on Thursday.With limited staff, the commission has struggled to enforce its campaign regulations, such as putting campaign posters in unauthorised areas. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your posters in public places. They will just be taken down,\u201d Mr. Garcia said.A more serious concern has been elections violence. Local elections have been marred in the past by bloody feuds and accusations of cheating, especially in rural regions with weak law enforcement and a proliferation of unlicensed firearms and private armies. Last December, motorcycle-riding gunmen killed a town Mayor and wounded another in a brazen attack in southern Zamboanga city, where they alighted after travelling by speedboat from a nearby island. The attackers escaped. The victims reportedly were planning to run for re-election in the May elections and investigators said at the time that they were checking if it was linked to political rivalry.In 2009, heavily armed men deployed by the family of southern Maguindanao province\u2019s then-Governor massacred 58 people, including journalists, in an open attack on a convoy of a rival political clan that shocked the world. Outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly warned he would deploy the military if candidates resort to violence and fraud.\u201cNobody wants trouble, nobody wants cheating,\u201d he said in a speech in September in south Mindanao region, where many elections security hotspots have been identified by the police.\u201cThe military is the guardian of our country and I could call them anytime to see to it that people are protected and election\u2019s freely, orderly exercised,\u201d said Mr. Duterte, who has long been condemned himself for the thousands of killings of mostly petty suspects in his bloody crackdown against illegal drugs."

        "title": "\nDocument indicates China could boost military in Solomons\n",
        "text": "A leaked document indicates that China could boost its military presence in the Solomon Islands \u2014 including with ship visits \u2014 in a development that is raising alarm in nearby Australia and beyond. The Solomon Islands revealed on March 25 that it had signed a policing cooperation agreement with China. But more concerning to Australia was the draft text of a broader security arrangement that was leaked online. Under the terms of the draft agreement, China could send police, military personnel and other armed forces to the Solomons \u201cto assist in maintaining social order\u201d and for a variety of other reasons. It could also send ships to the islands for stopovers and to replenish supplies.The draft agreement stipulates that China would need to sign off on any information that\u2019s released about joint security arrangements, including at media briefings. Anna Powles, a senior lecturer in international security at New Zealand's Massey University, said Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. would all be \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the draft agreement, which was ambitious on China's part.Ms. Powles said it would be interesting to know what kind of goods China might want to send to the Solomons to service its ships and whether there was the potential for mission creep in the future, like China developing a naval base. She said she was concerned China was trying to direct the political narrative by controlling what information could be publicly released.A lot of the wording in the draft agreement was vague, Ms. Powles said, including exactly what type of military and paramilitary forces that China might send to the Solomons. She said it was either clumsily worded or deliberately opaque.Without directly addressing the content of the draft agreement, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a statement saying \u201cWe would be concerned by any actions that destabilise the security of our region.\u201d The department said that after riots last year in the Solomon Islands' capital, Honiara, Australia and its neighbours had been able to send security assistance \u201cwithout the need for external support.\u201d \u201cPacific Island nations have the right to make sovereign decisions,\u201d the department said. \u201cAustralia's cooperation with our Pacific family is focussed on the economic prosperity, security and development of our region.\u201d New Zealand said it planned to raise its concerns about the document with both the Solomon Islands and China. \u201cIf genuine, this agreement would be very concerning,\u201d Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said. \u201cSuch agreements will always be the right of any sovereign country to enter into; however, developments within this purported agreement could destabilise the current institutions and arrangements that have long underpinned the Pacific region's security.\u201d It was not immediately clear when the security agreement might be finalised, signed or go into effect.The Solomon Islands, home to about 7,00,000 people, in 2019 switched its diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to Beijing, which was a contributing factor to last year's riots.Last month the U.S. announced plans to open an embassy in the Solomon Islands, laying out in unusually blunt terms a plan to increase its influence in the South Pacific nation before China becomes \u201cstrongly embedded.\u201d The U.S. previously operated an embassy in the Solomons for five years before closing it in 1993. Since then, the U.S. diplomats from neighbouring Papua New Guinea have been accredited to the Solomons, which has a U.S. consular agency. A news release from the Solomon Islands government on its new policing agreement with China revealed few details. The statement said the agreement had been signed in a virtual meeting between China's Wang Xiaohong, an Executive Vice_Minister and Solomon Islands Police Minister Anthony Veke.Wang said in the release that since the Solomon Islands began diplomatically recognising China, \u201cthe bilateral relations have developed rapidly and achieved fruitful results\" and that China was ready to \u201cadvance practical cooperation in police and law enforcement.\" Mr. Veke, meanwhile, said the Solomon Islands government attached great importance to its relationship with China."

        "title": "\nCOVID-19 rates plunge as decision nears on U.S. asylum limits\n",
        "text": "One by one, a voice called out the names of 169 people just released by the U.S. Border Patrol. Migrants rose from folding chairs in a clinic warehouse and walked to a table of blue-robed workers, who swabbed their mouths.All but two Cuban women tested negative for COVID-19 that February morning. They were quarantined to motel rooms, while other migrants boarded chartered buses to Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport for flights across the U.S. Theirs were among just seven of 5,301 tests the Regional Center for Border Health near Yuma, Arizona, did last month for released migrants that were positive \u2014 a rate of 0.1%COVID-19 rates are plunging among migrants crossing the border from Mexico as the Biden administration faces a Tuesday deadline to end or extend sweeping restrictions on asylum that are aimed at limiting the virus' spread. Lower rates raise more questions about scientific grounds for a public health order that has caused migrants to be expelled from the United States more than 1.7 million times since March 2020 without a chance to request asylum. While there is no aggregate rate for migrants, test results from several major corridors for illegal border crossings suggest it is well below levels that have triggered concerns among U.S. officials. In California, 54 of 2,877 migrants tested positive the first two weeks of March, according to the state Department of Social Services. That's a rate of just 1.9%, down from a peak of 28.2% on Jan. 8.In Pima County, Arizona, which includes Tucson, the seven-day positivity rate among migrants didn't exceed 1.3% in early March and dropped to 0.9% on March 10. The seven-day rate topped 5% on only two days during the final three months of last year. Then, as the omicron variant spread, it surged to double-digits for most of January, peaking at 19.2% on Jan. 12 and falling below 5% on February 12.McAllen, Texas, the largest city in the busiest corridor for illegal crossings, has a higher rate among migrants \u2014 9.2% on March 2 \u2014 but it is also falling and is consistently lower than the general population. Only two of 24 border counties have had high rates in the general population: Hidalgo, which includes McAllen, and Yuma in Arizona.The rate among migrants in McAllen peaked at 20.8% the last week of January, when it was double that in the general population. It bottomed at 1.4% the last week of November, when the general population was at 6.2%.As mask mandates have lifted, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is under mounting pressure to fully restore asylum by ending Title 42, named for a 1944 public health law. Critics say it has been an excuse to wriggle out of asylum obligations under U.S. law and international treaty.Justin Walker, a federal appeals court judge in Washington, wrote this month that it was \u201cfar from clear that the CDC order serves any purpose\u201d for public health. Mr. Walker, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, noted that the Biden administration hasn\u2019t provided detailed evidence to support the restrictions.\u201cThe CDC\u2019s order looks in certain respects like a relic from an era with no vaccines, scarce testing, few therapeutics, and little certainty,\u201d Walker wrote for a three-judge panel.CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky noted falling rates when she ended asylum limits on unaccompanied child migrants on March 11, while keeping them for adults and families with kids. In August, U.S. border authorities began testing children traveling alone in their busiest areas: positives fell to 6% in the first week of March from a high of nearly 20% in early February.The White House and Homeland Security Department have said decisions on Title 42 rest with the CDC. Ms. Walensky told reporters Wednesday that the CDC was reviewing data ahead of next week's deadline, noting that its two-month renewal in late January came near the peak of the omicron variant. Scientific arguments for Title 42 have met with skepticism from the start.The Associated Press reported in 2020 that Vice President Mike Pence directed the CDC to use its emergency powers, overruling agency scientists who said there was no evidence it would slow the coronavirus. Anne Schuchat, the second-highest ranking CDC until last May, told members of Congress after her departure that the asylum limits lacked foundation as a public health measure when introduced.\u201cThe bulk of the evidence at that time did not support this policy proposal,\u201d she said.Title 42 also has supporters. In a ruling this month in a lawsuit over the order, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman in Fort Worth, Texas, said: \u201cThere should be no disagreement that the current immigration policies should be focused on stopping the spread of COVID-19.\u201dEven while large-scale expulsions were carried out under Title 42, the U.S. processed more than 2.8 million cases under normal immigration laws, which allow people to seek asylum. With costs and strained diplomatic relations limiting expulsions to many countries, migrants are often released to nongovernmental groups and ordered to appear later in immigration court. The groups test for COVID-19.In El Paso, Annunciation House saw positives plunge to around 2% among the roughly 175 migrants it tested daily in early March, said director Ruben Garcia. Positives were close to 40% at the height of the omicron variant, he said.In Arizona, at the Regional Center for Binational Health, monthly rates peaked at 3% last year. Still, Amanda Aguirre, its president, is wary about lifting Title 42.\u201cMy concern is that at any time we\u2019re going to see new variants coming into this area,\u201d she said. The Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition, which tests migrants in the busy Del Rio, Texas, area, said it went several weeks without a single positive.\u201cYesterday there was one positive and today there was one positive \u2014 that\u2019s out of hundreds tested,\u201d the group wrote last week in response to questions.

This is a fundamental challenge for the European security and defence system,\u201d he said, calling for Europe to issue hard\u2013hitting weekly sanctions packages against Russia.He warned Sweden that Moscow had its Baltic Sea island of Gotland in its sights.\rSweden reopened its garrison on Gotland in 2018, in the wake of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, after shutting it down in 2004.\u201cIt would mean that you are in danger, because it is only the sea that divides you and this aggressive policy,\u201d he said.\u201cRussian propagandists already discuss on air, on TV broadcasts, how Russia will occupy Gotland and how they will control it for decades,\u201d he said.\u201cThey think it would be comfortable to put anti\u2013defence systems and bases there to cover the advance on the Baltic states.\u201dMr. Zelensky thanked Sweden for its support, after it agreed to ship weapons to a country at war for the first time since 1939.\rNot a member of NATO and officially militarily non\u2013aligned, Stockholm on Thursday announced a second delivery of 5,000 anti\u2013tank launchers.Support for NATO membership has soared in Sweden since Russia\u2019s invasion but Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson has so far ruled out the idea.Joining the alliance risks \u2018destabilising\u2019 northern Europe, she said.Mr. Zelensky, who has made multiple appearances by video link before Parliaments in other countries in recent weeks, was due to address an extraordinary NATO summit later Thursday.In a separate video address, Mr. Zelensky made an impassioned plea for citizens worldwide to pour onto streets and squares in global protest against Russia\u2019s invasion.\u201cThe world must stop the war,\u201d he said. \u201cCome from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities, come in the name of peace, come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.\u201d"

        "text": "As Russia launched its war in Ukraine last month, exhausted and frightened refugees arrived in neighbouring countries. They carried whatever they could grab in a hurry. Many cried. They still do.\rThe United Nations says that more than 3.6 million people have fled Ukraine since the war started exactly one month ago Thursday in what is the biggest movement of people in Europe since the Second World War. Unprepared, most refugees believed they would soon be back home. That hope is waning now.\u201cAt the beginning, we thought that this would end pretty soon,\u201d Olha Homienko, a 50-year-old woman from Kharkiv said. \u201cFirst of all, nobody could believe Russia would attack us, and we thought that it would end quickly.\u201d\rNow, Homienko said, \"as we can see, there is nothing to look forward to.\u201d\rHomienko's hometown of Kharkiv is among several Ukrainian cities and towns that have been encircled and shelled heavily by the Russians. Refugees coming from besieged towns have told of destruction, death and hunger.\rNatalia Lutsenko, from the bombed-out northern town of Chernihiv, said she still thought the Russian invasion must be some kind of \u2018misunderstanding\u2019. Lutsenko said she couldn't comprehend why Russian President Vladimir Putin makes Ukrainians suffer so much.\u201cWhy is he bombing peaceful homes? Why there are so many victims, blood, and killed children, body parts everywhere?\u201d Lutsenko pleaded. \u201cIt is horrible. Sleepless nights. Parents are crying, there are no children any more.\u201d\rAfter fleeing her home, Lutsenko came to Medyka, a small town on the border between Ukraine and Poland where refugees have been coming since the start of the invasion.\rMedyka Mayor Marek Iwasieczko clearly remembers February 24, the first day of the war.\u201cThat day was a big surprise for me. Suddenly the huge number of people appeared in Medyka,\u201d Mr. Iwasieczko recalled. \u201cThey had been traveling for four days. They came terribly exhausted, it was still cold, they were freezing.\"Though the Medyka authorities had prepared some facilities in advance for the arrival of refugees, the town was still overwhelmed with the thousands of people arriving at the same time and needing shelter, food, medicines and most of all, warmth and comfort.\rMr. Iwasieczko also said everyone believed to the last moment that the war would be avoided.\u201cEverything was prepared, even though we were not sure whether all this would be necessary, we did not to know that the war would start, that this would be Putin\u2019s way of doing things,\u201d he said. A month later, \"we are dreaming about the stabilization and the end of this situation ... We are tired but we are going to help until the end.\u201d\rIn Przemysl, another Polish town where refugees from Ukraine arrive by train, 66-year-old Nelya Kot from Chernihiv said she remembers waking up to the sound of air raid and explosions when the war started on Feb. 24.\r\"I thought maybe it was a drill, but then realized that if it were only a drill you wouldn\u2019t hear explosions,\u201d she said. \u201cAt that moment my daughter called and said \u2018Mom, Russia has attacked us.\u2019\u201d\rOne month later, Kot added, people in Chernihiv drink river water to survive. Kot\u2019s nephew was killed while waiting for bread, and devastation is everywhere, she said.\r\u201cToday, (in Chernihiv) there is no water, no gas, no electricity in the city, Kot gasped. \u201cPeople are in total isolation, they drink water from the Desna river.\u201d\rTo ease the strain on the countries accepting refugees, the European Union announced moves Wednesday to help its member states assist the millions of refugees in accessing schools for their children, health care, accommodation and work.\rThe measures also aim to help facilitate the movement of refugees between countries that can house them in the EU and other countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom, which already have large Ukrainian communities.\rMostly women and children - Ukrainian men from age 18 to 60 have been banned from leaving the country and stay to fight \u2014 the refugees have sought to rebuild their lives in neighboring countries, seek jobs and start schools. Some have moved on other nations where they have relatives.\rMaria Tykha, a 29-year-old refugee also from Kharkiv, still doesn't know what he will do next. After arriving Thursday to Przemysl by train, she said \u201cI just can\u2019t believe that it is possible in the 21st century.\u201d\rIn Medyka, the refugees are still arriving, though in smaller numbers and in warmer weather. On Wednesday, children could be seen clutching their favorite toys, women carrying babies and people arriving with their dogs, whom they refused to leave behind.\rLutsenko was sitting on her bed in a sports hall that has been turned into a refugee center, with dozens of beds lined up in one central area. She too had thought the war would be over in just a few days.\r\u201cNobody thought it would last this long, for a month.,\" she said. \u201d I believe that Ukraine will win and I believe in our army. I still believe.\"\r"

The first resolution was adopted with support from 140 countries and the second was not put to vote because it did not have sufficient support.\rThe draft version of Ukraine\u2019s resolution named Russia, saying the UNGA \u201cdemands an immediate cessation of the hostilities by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, in particular of any attacks against civilians and civilian objects.\u201d The 140 countries that voted in its favour included the U.S. and European Union countries.

Also, in another development, India, along with 12 other UN Security Council members, abstained on a resolution by Russia on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.The draft resolution was co-sponsored by Syria, North Korea and Belarus.

        "text": "NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will remain in his role for an extra year to help steer the 30-nation military organization through the security crisis sparked by Russia's war on Ukraine. Stoltenberg tweeted Thursday that he is \u201chonoured\u201d by the decision of NATO leaders to extend his term until Sept 30, 2023.Honoured by the decision of #NATO Heads of State and Government to extend my term as Secretary General until 30 September 2023.

The former Norwegian prime minister was named to NATO's top civilian post in October 2014. It's the second time that his term of office has been extended. His mandate was due to expire in September. In February, Norway's government appointed Stoltenberg as head of the Scandinavian country's central bank and said it hoped he could start in his new role around Dec 1. In Oslo, Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum confirmed that Stoltenberg had resigned from the job. Deputy governor Ida Wolden Bache has been nominated in Stoltenberg's place and her appointment is expected to be confirmed later Thursday. \u201cOf course I would like to see Jens Stoltenberg become our next central bank governor, but we are in the middle of a dramatic situation in Europe and I have great understanding that he prioritizes continuing in the important role he has in NATO,\u201d Slagsvold Vedum said.

Stoltenberg has been praised for steering NATO through a difficult and divisive period under the Trump administration, when the US threatened not to come to the aid of member countries that weren't spending enough on defense.

        "title": "\nAfter surprise stopover in Kabul, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi lands in Delhi\u00a0\n",
        "text": "China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday made a surprise visit to Kabul, travelling to the Afghan capital for meetings before landing in Delhi on Thursday night. Both visits had been kept completely secret, and neither Delhi nor Beijing have formally issued any statement on Mr. Wang\u2019s travels to India yet. On Friday, Mr. Wang is due to meet with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to discuss the way forward in resolving the two year old military stand-off at the Line of Actual Control and PLA transgressions along the LAC. Mr. Wang is also expected to extend an invitation to the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) summit in Beijing this year, as well as the situation in Ukraine, before flying to Kathmandu for the next leg of his South Asia tour, which began in Islamabad on Tuesday. However, it is unclear whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet Mr. Wang, as the Chinese side that proposed the visit, had requested. Mr. Wang arrived in Delhi a day after the Ministry of External Affairs sharply rebuked his comments at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Pakistan, where he referred to \u201csharing hopes for Kashmir\u201d, a statement that appeared to cast a cloud over his visit to Delhi amidst deep tensions between India and China on a large number of other issues. In Kabul, Mr. Wang held talks with Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, which a spokesperson said had focussed on \u201cpolitical, economic and transit issues\u201d, including trade, education, visas, as well as the mining sector and Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects in Afghanistan. China plans to host a meeting of Afghanistan\u2019s neighbours later this month, and the visit to Kabul, and expected visit by Mr. Muttaqi to Beijing are the highest level engagement between China and the Taliban regime since it took power in Kabul in August 2021. However, Beijing was noncommittal on whether Mr. Wang would invite India to \u201cForeign Ministers\u2019 Meeting among the Neighbouring Countries of Afghanistan\u201d. \u201cAs Afghanistan's neighbour, China stands ready to leverage its strength and contribute to the country\u2019s lasting stability and security. With regard to your question about the specifics, we will release information in due course,\u201d Chinese MFA spokesperson Wang Wenbin said, when asked on Thursday. Mr. Wang has engaged with the Taliban previously, hosting a delegation led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in Tianjin near Beijing in July last year, shortly before the Taliban takeover. While most countries, including India, closed their embassies as Kabul fell, China underlined its comfort with the Taliban by keeping its mission open, and in recent months, the Taliban has courted Chinese investment, although Beijing has only provided limited financial support so far amid the unprecedented economic and humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. This month, Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Mines and Petroleum said talks were under way with China\u2019s Metallurgical Group Corporation over re-starting work in the massive Mes Aynak copper mine and that a Chinese team would arrive end-March. \u201cThey will be physically in Kabul in March and will discuss the issue with the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum,\u201d Esmatullah Borhan, spokesman of the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, told Afghanistan\u2019s TOLO News, with plans to resume a stalled project that includes \u201cconstruction of a railway from Torkham border to Hairatan Port, a thermal power plant with a capacity of four hundred megawatts, the construction of Mes Aynak road, and copper processing inside Afghanistan\u201d. The security situation there, however, remains a concern for Chinese companies, an issue Mr. Wang was expected to take up with the Taliban. In Pakistan earlier, Mr. Wang discussed with Prime Minister Imran Khan plans to extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry quoted Mr. Khan as saying that \u201cChina-Afghanistan-Pakistan cooperation is conducive to stability in Afghanistan and its role as a hub in regional connectivity\u201d and that Pakistan \u201cis ready to work with China to jointly advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan.\u201d China and Pakistan have previously spoken about aligning their Afghanistan strategies, with both sharing good relations with the Taliban. Mr. Wang also discussed Afghanistan with Pakistan\u2019s Chief of Army Staff Qamar Javed Bajwa. Criticising the West, he said \u201cthe Afghan issue should not be solved by exerting pressure or imposing sanctions, but by drawing on the wisdom of the East to promote dialogue and communication.\u201d \u201cBoth China and Pakistan encourage the ruling authorities of Afghanistan to actively build an open and inclusive political architecture, implement moderate and prudent domestic and foreign policies and resolutely combat terrorism in all its forms,\u201d he said.

        "text": "The search area was expanded on March 24 for the second black box from a China Eastern passenger jet that crashed in southern China with 132 people on board earlier this week, state broadcaster CCTV said.Off-and-on rain was impeding the search for a second straight day. One of the black boxes, believed to be the cockpit voice recorder, was found on Wednesday. \u201cIts outer casing was damaged but the orange cylinder was relatively intact,\u201d investigators said. The Boeing 737-800 was cruising at 29,000ft (8,800 meters) when it suddenly nose-dived into a remote mountainous area on Monday, setting off a fire in the surrounding forest that could be seen in NASA satellite images. No survivors have been found.Searchers have been using hand tools, metal detectors, drones and sniffer dogs to comb the heavily forested and steep slopes. Wallets, identity and bank cards and human remains have been found.CCTV news showed police in olive- and dark-colored rain gear standing in a cleared area on Thursday, some with bare or white-gloved hands atop long-handled tools that appear to be shovels or sickles. They all wore surgical masks. Recovering the so-called black boxes \u2014 they are usually painted orange for visibility \u2014 is considered key to figuring out what caused the crash. Cockpit voice recorders can capture voices, audio alerts and background sounds from the engine or even switches being moved. The flight data recorder stores information about the plane\u2019s airspeed, altitude and direction up or down, as well as pilot actions and the performance of important systems.Investigators have said it is too early to speculate on the cause. An air-traffic controller tried to contact the pilots several times after seeing the plane\u2019s altitude drop sharply, but got no reply, officials have said.The China Eastern flight was headed from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, to Guangzhou, a major city and export manufacturing hub on China's southeastern coast. China Eastern, headquartered in Shanghai, is one of China's four major airlines."

        "text": "North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on March 24, South Korea\u2019s President Moon Jae-in said, the first time Pyongyang has launched such a powerful weapon since 2017.It was a \u201cbreach of the suspension of intercontinental ballistic missile launches promised by Chairman Kim Jong Un to the international community,\u201d Moon said in a statement, adding it was also in violation of UN sanctions.Japan's Prime Minster's Office Defence Ministry said the North fired a possible ballistic missile. Japan\u2019s coast guard, which warned vessels in nearby waters about the potential for falling objects, said it believed the missile flew about an hour before landing in waters outside the country\u2019s exclusive economic zone.It was North Korea\u2019s 12th round of weapons launches this year and came after it fired suspected artillery pieces into the sea on Sunday. Experts say the North\u2019s unusually fast pace in testing activity underscore its dual goal of advancing its weaponry and applying pressure on Washington over a deepening freeze in nuclear negotiations.The North has also tested a variety of new missiles, including a purported hypersonic weapon and its first launch since 2017 of an intermediate range missile potentially capable of reaching Guam, a key U. S. military hub in the Pacific. It conducted two medium-range tests from near its capital area in recent weeks that the U. S. and South Korean militaries later assessed as involving components of the North\u2019s largest ICBM, the Hwasong-17, which they said could be tested at full range soon.North Korea\u2019s official media insisted that those two tests were aimed at developing cameras and other systems for a spy satellite. Analysts say the North is clearly attempting to simultaneously resume ICBM testing and acquire some level of space-based reconnaissance capability under the pretense of a space launch to reduce international backlash to those moves.The launch may possibly come around a major political anniversary in April, the birthday of state founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un.The North\u2019s previous ICBMs demonstrated potential range to reach the American homeland during three flight tests in 2017. Its development of the larger Hwasong-17, which was first revealed in a military parade in October 2020, possibly indicates an aim to arm it with multiple warheads to overwhelm missile defences, experts say.\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s slew of weapons tests this year, which comes amid a prolonged stalemate in diplomacy, reflects a determination to cement its status as a nuclear and badly needed economic concessions from Washington and other rivals from a position of strength,\u201d analysts say."

        "text": "Ukraine President Volodymr Zelenskyy called on people worldwide to gather in public on March 24 to show support for his embattled country on the one-month anniversary of the Russian invasion that he said breaks the heart of \u201cevery free person on the planet.\u201dMr. Zelenskyy \u2014 whose video messages have repeatedly riveted the world\u2019s attention \u2014 also said he would speak to NATO members by video to ask the alliance to provide \u201ceffective and unrestricted\u201d support to Ukraine, including any weapons the country needs to fend off the Russian onslaught.\u201cCome to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard,\u201d Mr. Zelenskyy said in English during an emotional video address late Wednesday that was recorded in the dark near the presidential offices in Kyiv. \u201cSay that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters.\u201dWhen Russia unleashed its invasion on February 24 in Europe\u2019s biggest offensive since World War II, a swift toppling of Ukraine\u2019s government seemed likely. But with Wednesday marking four full weeks of fighting, Moscow is bogged down in a grinding military campaign. NATO estimated that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in four weeks of war in Ukraine, where fierce resistance has denied Moscow the lightning victory it sought.By way of comparison, Russia lost about 15,000 troops over 10 years in Afghanistan. A senior NATO military official said the alliance\u2019s estimate was based on information from Ukrainian authorities, what Russia has released \u2014 intentionally or not \u2014 and intelligence gathered from open sources. The official spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by NATO.In its last update, Russia said on March 2 that nearly 500 soldiers had been killed and almost 1,600 wounded. Ukraine has released little information about its own military losses and the West has not given an estimate, but Mr. Zelenskyy said nearly two weeks ago that about 1,300 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed. Ukraine also claims to have killed six Russian generals. Russia acknowledges just one dead general.With its ground forces slowed or stopped by hit-and-run Ukrainian units armed with Western-supplied weapons, Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops are bombarding targets from afar, falling back on the tactics they used in reducing cities to rubble in Syria and Chechnya.A senior U.S. defence official said on Wednesday that Russian ground forces appear to be digging in and setting up defensive positions 15 to 20km (9 to 12 miles) outside Kyiv, the capital, as they make little to no progress toward the city centre.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said it appears the forces are no longer trying to advance into the city and in some areas east of Kyiv, Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian soldiers farther away.Instead, Russian troops appear to be prioritising the fight in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the Donbas, in what could be an effort to cut off Ukrainian troops and prevent them from moving west to defend other cities, the official said. The U.S. also has seen activity from Russian ships in the Sea of Azov, including what appear to be efforts to send landing ships ashore with supplies, including vehicles, the official said.Despite evidence to the contrary, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted the military operation is going \u201cstrictly in accordance\u201d with plans. In an ominous sign that Moscow might consider using nuclear weapons, a senior Russian official said the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal would help deter the West from intervening in Ukraine.\u201cThe Russian Federation is capable of physically destroying any aggressor or any aggressor group within minutes at any distance,\u201d said Dmitry Rogozin, who heads the state aerospace corporation, Roscosmos, and oversees missile-building facilities. He noted in his televised remarks that Moscow\u2019s nuclear stockpiles include tactical nuclear weapons, designed for use on battlefields, along with far more powerful nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles.U.S. officials long have warned that Russia\u2019s military doctrine envisages an \u201cescalate to deescalate\u201d option of using battlefield nuclear weapons to force the enemy to back down in a situation when Russian forces face imminent defeat. Moscow has denied having such plans.Mr. Rogozin, known for his bluster, did not make clear what actions by the West would be seen as meddling, but his comments almost certainly reflect thinking inside the Kremlin. Mr. Putin has warned the West that an attempt to introduce a no-fly zone over Ukraine would draw it into a conflict with Russia. Western nations have said they would not create a no-fly zone to protect Ukraine.As U. S. President Joe Biden headed to Europe to meet with key allies about new sanctions against Moscow and more military aid to Ukraine, he warned there is a \u201creal threat\" Russia could use chemical weapons.On the eve of a meeting with Mr. Biden, European Union nations signed off on another 500 million euros ($550 million) in military aid for Ukraine. Mr. Zelenskyy appealed to Western countries to stay united in the face of Russia\u2019s efforts to \u201clobby its interests\u201d with \u201csome partners\u201d to bring them over to its side and noted during his national address that Ukraine has not received the fighter jets or modern air-defence systems it requested. He said Ukraine also needs tanks and anti-ship systems.\u201cIt has been a month of defending ourselves from attempts to destroy us, wipe us off the face of the earth,\u201d he said. The U. S. has determined that Russian troops have committed war crimes in Ukraine and it will work to prosecute the offenders, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. He cited evidence of indiscriminate or deliberate attacks against civilians and the destruction of apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, shopping centres and other sites.In Kyiv, where near-constant shelling and gunfire shook the city Wednesday as the two sides battled for control of multiple suburbs, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said at least 264 civilians have been killed since the war broke out. The independent Russian news outlet The Insider said Russian journalist Oksana Baulina had been killed by shelling in a Kyiv neighbourhood on Wednesday.In the south, the encircled port city of Mariupol has seen the worst devastation of the war, enduring weeks of bombardment and, now, street-by-street fighting. But Ukrainian forces have prevented its fall, thwarting an apparent bid by Moscow to fully secure a land bridge from Russia to Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014.In their last update, over a week ago, Mariupol officials said at least 2,300 people had died, but the true toll is probably much higher. Airstrikes in the past week destroyed a theatre and an art school where civilians were sheltering.Mr. Zelenskyy said 1,00,000 civilians remain in the city, which had a population of 4,30,000 before the war. Efforts to get desperately needed food and other supplies to those trapped have often failed. Mr. Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the Russians were holding captive 11 bus drivers and four rescue workers along with their vehicles. In the besieged northern city of Chernihiv, Russian forces bombed and destroyed a bridge that was used for aid deliveries and civilian evacuations, regional governor Viacheslav Chaus said.Kateryna Mytkevich, 39, who arrived in Poland after fleeing Chernihiv, wiped away tears as she said the city is without gas, electricity or running water, and entire neighbourhoods have been destroyed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why we have such a curse,\" she said."

        "text": "China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi is expected to arrive in New Delhi on Thursday for talks on Friday with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. The visit takes place amid the unresolved crisis along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as well as the ongoing crisis following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, both of which are expected to be discussed. Ahead of the visit, The Hindu spoke to Hu Shisheng, a leading Chinese expert on India-China relations and Director of the Institute for South Asian Studies at the China Institutes for Contemporary International Relations in Beijing. Edited for clarity.How do you assess the current state of India-China relations?\u00a0There are \u201cthree weaks\u201d [weaknesses] in bilateral relations: weak mutual strategic trust, weak forward-driving forces, and weak bilateral interactions.\u00a0The basic reason is that the requirements for mutually beneficial developmental cooperation has been replaced or dwarfed by the demands for defensiveness in security.Do you see the Ukraine crisis as having an impact on the current state of the relationship?\u00a0The crisis has\u00a0further proved that U.S.-dominated institutions are not reliable. It is now up to India, China, and non-western countries to make joint efforts to moderate, or even invent institutions, to safeguard our national interests during the crisis. It is time for us two giants to do something out of the box, to step out of the shadows\u2026 Due to our giant weight, our rules and our criteria will become the international rules and international criteria.How do you view India\u2019s stand on Ukraine, given that recently, many observers in China have made the claim that India is now fully in the U.S. camp. They have been focusing a lot on the Quad, even calling it an \u201cAsian NATO\u201d, a label which India rejects. In that sense, has India\u2019s stand come as a surprise?\u00a0\u00a0India\u2019s stand is very similar to China\u2019s. We are very clear on what have been\u00a0the fundamental reasons behind this current humanitarian crisis. We know that the Western world is not completely innocent and has some ulterior motives. Both China and India don\u2019t want to see a much weakened, much isolated Russia, which means a more vulnerable regional and global order.\u00a0At least in the Ukraine crisis, both India and China have many commonalities. We had better discuss this to see what we two can do for ending this crisis. We both have stakes in a stable and not so isolated Russia. Many Chinese scholars don\u2019t believe India will follow the policy of the U.S. and its allies against Russia. It just does not serve the national interest.On bilateral relations, India has said normal relations are not possible unless there is peace on the border. China has said the border should be kept in an appropriate place. These seem like two very contradictory positions. Do you see a way to bridge these two positions?\u00a0\u00a0It sounds very contradictory.\u00a0However, there is something which can bridge these two positions: both sides advocate we have to face the issue, not shelve it. Besides, the two have to do more efforts like maintaining dialogue, managing differences, making progress in disengagement, having some tolerance for managing the existing stand-offs along the LAC\u2026 But isn\u2019t India\u2019s stand similar to what China is arguing with the U.S., that you cannot have confrontation in some areas and expect to cooperate in others?\u00a0However, China has to deal with the U.S. anyway, and is grasping any opportunity to engage with the U.S., while New Delhi does not seem that flexible.What do you see as the big obstacle for LAC disengagement? Why, in your view, is China not willing for a return to status quo, which would seem to be in the interests of both sides?What is the status quo?\u00a0According to the Chinese understanding, the status quo had\u00a0better be the November 7, 1959, status quo. However, obviously, India will not accept it. So, in this case, the so-called status quo is a much blurred concept. My personal view is that if there exist not a few grey areas between the two respectively claimed LACs, such a status quo would be very difficult to define.And even after disengagement is completed, de-escalation needs to take place given that thousands of troops from both sides are in forward areas and new infrastructure is being built. Do you think de-escalation is a realistic goal, or is a more securitised LAC is here to stay?\u00a0If disengagement can be achieved along the western sector after some more time, I personally tend to believe there will be dramatic reduction of the military deployments along the border regions, since there will be no need for them anymore.\u00a0It will be crazy to imagine that China and India will fight another border war.If the LAC remains securitised, how do you see that impacting the broader relationship going forward and how both sides manage the border issue?The border issue, in my personal view, will finally be addressed in a mutually acceptable way. Even if it is just a disengagement arrangement without a treaty, which would be very okay. Then there will be no need any more to deploy so heavily along the border regions militarily.Compared to the border issue, the more challenging question in front of both of our countries is how these two neighbouring rising powers coexist peacefully forever. \u00a0There haven\u2019t been such examples in the international community for us to follow. We two have to think out of the box, the modality, the approach, for two rising giants to coexist peacefully."

        "text": "NATO estimated on Wednesday that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in four weeks of war in Ukraine, where fierce fighting by the country's fast-moving defenders has denied Moscow the lightning victory it sought.By way of comparison, Russia lost about 15,000 troops over 10 years in Afghanistan.A senior NATO military official said the alliance's estimate was based on information from Ukrainian authorities, what Russia has released \u2014 intentionally or not \u2014 and intelligence gathered from open sources. The official spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by NATO.When Russia unleashed its invasion February 24 in Europe's biggest offensive since World War II, a swift toppling of Ukraine's government seemed likely. But with Wednesday marking four full weeks of fighting, Moscow is bogged down in a grinding military campaign.With its ground forces slowed or stopped by hit-and-run Ukrainian units armed with Western-supplied weapons, Russian President Vladimir Putin's troops are bombarding targets from afar, falling back on the tactics they used in reducing cities to rubble in Syria and Chechnya.As U.S. President Joe Biden left for Europe to meet with key allies about new sanctions against Moscow and more military aid to Ukraine, he warned there is a \u201creal threat\" Russia could use chemical weapons.The U.S. government has also determined that Russian troops have committed war crimes in Ukraine, and it will work to prosecute the offenders, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. He cited evidence of indiscriminate or deliberate attacks against civilians and the destruction of apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, shopping centres and other sites.Addressing Japan's parliament, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said thousands of his people have been killed, including at least 121 children.\u201cOur people cannot even adequately bury their murdered relatives, friends and neighbors. They have to be buried right in the yards of destroyed buildings, next to the roads,\u201d he said.Still, major Russian objectives remain unfulfilled. The capital, Kyiv, has been bombarded repeatedly but is not even encircled.Near-constant shelling and gunfire shook the city Wednesday, with plumes of black smoke rising from the western outskirts, where the two sides battled for control of multiple suburbs. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said at least 264 civilians have been killed in the capital since the war broke out.In the south, the encircled port city of Mariupol has seen the worst devastation of the war, enduring weeks of bombardment and, now, street-by-street fighting. But Ukrainian forces have prevented its fall, thwarting an apparent bid by Moscow to fully secure a land bridge from Russia to Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014.Mr. Zelenskyy said 100,000 civilians remain in a city that had 430,000 people before the war. Efforts to get desperately needed food and other supplies to those trapped have often failed.Mr. Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the Russians were holding captive 11 bus drivers and four rescue workers along with their vehicles.In their last update, over a week ago, Mariupol officials said at least 2,300 people had died, but the true toll is probably much higher. Airstrikes in the past week destroyed a theater and an art school where civilians were sheltering.In the besieged northern city of Chernihiv, Russian forces bombed and destroyed a bridge that was used for aid deliveries and civilian evacuations, regional governor Viacheslav Chaus said.Kateryna Mytkevich, who arrived in Poland after fleeing Chernihiv, wiped away tears as she spoke about what she had seen. The city is without gas, electricity or running water, said Mytkevich, 39, and entire neighborhoods have been destroyed.\u201cI don't understand why we have such a curse,\" she said.Despite plenty of evidence to the contrary, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted the military operation is going \u201cstrictly in accordance\" with plans.The most recent figure for Ukraine's military losses came from Mr. Zelenskyy on March 12, when he said that about 1,300 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed in action.The NATO official said 30,000 to 40,000 Russian soldiers are estimated to have been killed or wounded.Russia has released very little information on its casualties, saying March 2 that nearly 500 soldiers had been killed and almost 1,600 wounded.Ukraine also claims to have killed six Russian generals. Russia acknowledges just one dead general.The figures from NATO represent the alliance's first public estimate of Russian casualties since the war began. The U.S. government has largely declined to provide estimates of Russian or Ukrainian casualties, saying available information is of questionable reliability.With casualties mounting and quick victory no longer in sight, Russia is having to work to suppress dissent and shore up morale.It has arrested thousands of antiwar protesters and cracked down on the media. Also, under a law passed Wednesday, troops in Ukraine will get the same benefits as veterans of previous wars, including tax breaks, discounts on utilities and preferential access to medical treatment.In an apparent reflection of growing divisions in Russia's top echelons, Anatoly Chubais has resigned, Mr. Peskov told the Interfax news agency. Mr. Chubais, the architect of Russia's post-Soviet privatisation campaign, had served in a variety of top posts over three decades. His latest role was as Mr. Putin's envoy to international organisations.Mr. Peskov would not say if Mr. Chubais had left the country.Western officials say Mr. Putin's forces are facing serious shortages of food, fuel and cold weather gear, with soldiers suffering frostbite, while Ukraine's defenders have been going more on the offensive.Still, Russia's far stronger, bigger military has many Western experts warning against overconfidence in Ukraine's long-term odds. The Kremlin's practice in past wars has been to grind down resistance by flattening cities, killing countless civilians and sending millions fleeing.Talks to end the fighting have continued by video. Mr. Zelenskyy said negotiations with Russia are going \u201cstep by step, but they are going forward.\u201d With no peace, those not yet fighting prepared to do so. \u201cEverything's a bestseller these days,\" said Zakhar Sluzhalyy, owner of a gun shop in the western city of Lviv.\"We're defending our land,\u201d he said. \"We're fighting for our freedom and that of the rest of Europe.\u201d "

        "text": "Madeleine Albright, a child refugee from Nazi- and then Soviet-dominated eastern Europe who rose to become the 1st female U.S. secretary of state and a mentor to many current and former American statesmen and women, has died of cancer, her family said Wednesday. She was 84.A lifelong Democrat who nonetheless worked to bring Republicans into her orbit, Ms. Albright was chosen by former President Bill Clinton to be America's top diplomat in 1996, elevating her from her post as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, where she had been only the second woman to hold that job.As secretary of state, Ms. Albright was the highest-ranking woman in the history of U.S. government. She was not in the line of succession to the presidency, however, because she was a native of Prague. The glass ceiling that she broke was universally admired, even by her political detractors.In announcing her death on Twitter, Ms. Albright's family said she died of cancer and was surrounded by family and friends: \u201cWe have lost a loving mother, grandmother, sister, aunt and friend,\u201d the statement said.\u201cLaura and I are heartbroken by the news of Madeleine Albright\u2019s death,\" said former President George W. Bush. \u201cShe lived out the American dream and helped others realize it.... She served with distinction as a foreign-born foreign minister who understood firsthand the importance of free societies for peace in our world. I respect her love of country and public service, and Laura and I are grateful to have called Madeline Albright our friend.\u201dPresident Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken had been informed of Mr. Albright's death as they were flying to Brussels for an emergency meeting of NATO leaders about Ukraine.Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. envoy to the United Nations, honoured Ms. Albright as a \u201ctrailblazer and a luminary\u201d in remarks on the General Assembly floor shortly after news of her death emerged. \u201cThe impact that she has had on this building is felt every single day and just about every single corridor,\u201d said State Department spokesman Ned Price, who once co-taught a class with Albright at his alma mater, Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, where Ms. Albright was a professor for decades before and after her time in government.\u201cShe was a trailblazer as the first female Secretary of State and quite literally opened doors for a large elements of our of our workforce,\u201d he said.In 2012, then President Barack Obama awarded Ms. Albright the Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honour, saying her life was an inspiration to all Americans.Ms. Albright remained outspoken through the years. After leaving office, she criticised President George W. Bush for using \u201cthe shock of force\u201d rather than alliances to foster diplomacy and said Mr. Bush had driven away moderate Arab leaders and created potential for a dangerous rift with European allies.However, as a refugee from Czechoslovakia who saw the horrors of both Nazi Germany and the Iron Curtain, she was not a dove and played a leading role in pressing for the Clinton administration to get militarily involved in the conflict in Kosovo.She also toed a hard line on Cuba, famously saying at the United Nations that the Cuban shootdown of a civilian plane was not \u201ccojones\u201d but rather \u201ccowardice.\u201dShe advised women \u201cto act in a more confident manner\u201d and \u201cto ask questions when they occur and don\u2019t wait to ask.\u201d\u201cIt took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent,\u201d she told HuffPost Living in 2010.When the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked her in January 2007 whether she approved of President Bush\u2019s proposed \u201csurge\u201d in U.S. troops in bloodied Iraq, she responded: \u201cI think we need a surge in diplomacy. We are viewed in the Middle East as a colonial power and our motives are suspect.\u201d Ms. Albright was an internationalist whose point of view was shaped in part by her background. Her family fled Czechoslovakia in 1939 as the Nazis took over their country, and she spent the war years in London. After the war, as the Soviet Union took over vast chunks of eastern Europe, her father, a Czech diplomat, brought his family to the U.S. As Secretary of State, Ms. Albright played a key role in persuading President Clinton to go to war against the Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic over his treatment of Kosovar Albanians in 1999. In her U.N. post, she advocated a tough U.S. foreign policy, particularly in the case of Milosevic\u2019s treatment of Bosnia and NATO\u2019s intervention in Kosovo was eventually dubbed \u201cMadeleine's War.\u201d \u201cMy mindset is Munich,\u201d she said frequently, referring to the German city where the Western allies abandoned her homeland to the Nazis.Ms. Albright helped win Senate ratification of NATO\u2019s expansion and a treaty imposing international restrictions on chemical weapons. She led a successful fight to keep Egyptian diplomat Boutros Boutros-Ghali from a second term as Secretary-General of the United Nations. He accused her of deception and posing as a friend.And she once exclaimed to Colin Powell, then the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, who would later succeed her as Secretary of State: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having this superb military you\u2019re always talking about if we can\u2019t use it?\u201dPowell, who died last year, recalled in a memoir that Ms. Albright\u2019s comments almost made him have an \u201caneurysm.\u201d\u201cI am an eternal optimist,\u201d Ms. Albright said in 1998, amid an effort as Secretary of State to promote peace in the Middle East. But she said getting Israel to pull back on the West Bank and the Palestinians to rout terrorists posed serious problems.As America\u2019s top diplomat, Ms. Albright made limited progress at first in trying to expand the 1993 Oslo Accords that established the principle of self-rule for the Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza. But in 1998, she played a leading role in formulating the Wye Accords that turned over control of about 40% of the West Bank to the Palestinians.She also spearheaded an ill-fated effort to negotiate a 2000 peace deal between Israel and Syria under Syria\u2019s late President Hafez al-Assad. And, she helped guide U.S. foreign policy during conflicts in the Balkans and the Hutu-Tutsi genocide in Rwanda.As an outspoken Democrat in private life, Ms. Albright often joked that she had her \u201cpolitical instincts surgically removed\u201d when she became secretary of state. True to that, she formed an unlikely friendship with arch-conservative North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms to increase funding for the State Department and U.S. diplomacy and oversaw a radical change in Washington\u2019s handling of Cold War-era messaging.Born Marie Jana Korbel in Prague on May 15, 1937, She was the daughter of a diplomat, Joseph Korbel. The family was Jewish and converted to Roman Catholicism when she was 5. Three of her Jewish grandparents died in concentration camps.Ms. Albright later said that she became aware of her Jewish background after she became Secretary of State. The family returned to Czechoslovakia after World War II but fled again, this time to the United States, in 1948, after the Communists rose to power.They settled in Denver, where her father obtained a job at the University of Denver. One of Josef Korbel\u2019s best students, a young woman named Condoleezza Rice, would later succeed his daughter as Secretary of State, the first Black woman to hold that office.Among current officials who worked closely with Ms. Albright are President Biden's domestic policy adviser and former U.N. ambassador Susan Rice, as well as Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and a host of others.Ms. Albright graduated from Wellesley College in 1959. She worked as a journalist and later studied international relations at Columbia University, where she earned a master\u2019s degree in 1968 and a Ph.D. in 1976.She worked for the National Security Council during the Carter administration and advised Democrats on foreign policy before Clinton\u2019s election. He nominated her as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in 1993.Following her service in the Clinton administration, she headed a global strategy firm, Albright Stonebridge, and was chair of an investment advisory company that focused on emerging markets.She also wrote several books. Ms. Albright married journalist Joseph Albright, a descendant of Chicago\u2019s Medill-Patterson newspaper dynasty, in 1959. They had three daughters and divorced in 1983."

        "title": "\nFlight data recorders of the crashed aircraft in China will provide the answers\u00a0\n",
        "text": "On March 21, 2022, a B737-800 aircraft of the China Eastern Airlines flight MU 5735 plunged into the ground killing all 132 on board. There were reports of rain in the area and overcast skies. Flightradar24 tracking of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) taken from the Mode-S transponder on board indicated a sudden drop in speed coupled with loss of altitude. The resultant steep descent, arrested for a short period with increase in speed, followed by another steep drop in altitude and speed, before the impact, indicates a probable \u201closs of control\u201d. Chinese authorities have grounded the B737-800 pending investigation and India\u2019s Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has announced increased surveillance of B737-800 aircraft operations. Is the aircraft system suspect?Having flown the B737-800 for more than 8,000 hours, I can say with certainty that the aircraft is very safe, provided the pilots understand the system and flight characteristics, especially in adverse weather conditions. Speculations are rife on possible causes, including pilot\u2019s suicide. A video of the final seconds of the crash before impact circulating in social media shows a near vertical descent of an aircraft without tail! The ADS-B data indicates a final descent rate close to 31,000 ft. per minute. This can be confirmed only with the Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) reading, when it is located. The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) will give a clear picture of conversations and audio warning sounds inside the cockpit. It is very critical to locate and decipher the DFDR and CVR recordings to identify the real cause.Unlike the Silkair MI-185 crash on December 19, 1997 which descended at a similar high rate and killed all 104 on board, and which has been identified as pilot suicide by the U.S.\u2019 National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the MU 5735 had the transponders on for signals to be recorded almost until the final moments. In the Silkair crash, the tail was intact and the clue was provided by the stabiliser screw jack, which was located in the wreckage. If it had been a mechanical system failure, the stabiliser setting would have been two degrees but it was found at the zero setting that was possible only with manual selection. The descent profile was possible only with manual control. MU 5735 had three pilots on board and the CVR read-out will clear any doubt on what transpired inside the cockpit.The profile recorded by the ADS-B indicates the loss of control due to the flight being in the vicinity of a huge thunderstorm cloud. A satellite image of the area will indicate if CBs were present, like the fatal flight of AF 447 crash in the Atlantic on June 1, 2009. The track from Kunming to Guangzhou is hilly with ranges having peaks from 7,000 ft to 10,000 ft. If there are strong winds, eddies can exist up to two-and-a-half times the height of the hill. If cumulonimbus clouds tower over 40,000 ft, the core will have very strong updrafts which come out of the underside of the overhand, popularly known as the anvil, as extremely strong down drafts. The high descent profile of the crashed aircraft indicates a presence of the strong down draft.The ADS-B data from Flightradar24 site has this crucial data in the 30 seconds between 06.20.43Z and 06.21.09. While the aircraft is maintaining the heading on 100 degrees, there is a sharp decline in speed from 457kts to 386kts and a descent rate building up to 31,000 ft per minute.All modern jet aircraft engines have Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC) and the engine thrust is controlled by FADEC to prevent over-boosting and to have optimum thrust settings. The main setting is based on ambient temperatureThe flight was maintaining 29,000 ft and the FADEC would have adjusted the thrust requirement for the ambient temperature at 29,000 ft. When the strong updraft moves the airmass from a lower level across the path of the flight, FADEC would sense the new warm airmass and reduce the thrust to prevent over-boosting of the engine. The only indication to the pilot, if he was monitoring the Total Air Temperature (TAT), indicating an increase in temperature. If the pilots had recognised that \u2014 unfortunately, very few monitor TAT \u2014 he should have taken the Altitude Hold Mode off and used control wheel steering to ride the waves. Leaving the autopilot engaged in Lateral Navigation and Vertical Navigation (LNAV/VNAV) mode will result in the aircraft maintaining altitude, autopilot will keep trimming the stabiliser back to relieve control forces, and speed will keep dropping. The reaction of the pilot to increase maximum thrust will have no effect as FADEC will not permit the engine to increase thrust due to the warm air mass encountered. The rapid drop in speed and the high rate of descent induced indicates a stall due to loss of control as the aircraft may have moved into areas with extreme downdraft. To un-stall the wing, the pilot may have used the stabiliser trim for nose down, which will result in the speed increasing and thrust increasing as the temperature at lower altitude will allow the thrust to increase. The resultant pitch up would give momentary gain in height followed by the pitch induced nose down due to the stabiliser trimming for nose down.Were the crew aware of high altitude jet upset recovery manoeuvre? Were they trained for such an eventuality? Grounding a hundred B737-NGs in one airline while hundreds of others are flying in China shows more of a knee jerk reaction. The Indian DGCA following suit with surveillance makes it worse as far as safety consciousness is concerned. It shows a complete lack of knowledge by the Flight Standards Directorate of the DGCA, if they have advised this move. There are thousands of B737-NGs flying in the world and it is a safe aircraft. Panic reaction creates doubts in the minds of passengers. It is better to learn from accidents and take steps to prevent a recurrence. The DFDR and CVR of the crashed aircraft will provide the answers.Capt. A. (Mohan) Ranganathan is a retired airline instructor pilot and aviation safety expert."

        "text": "The illegal entry of 16 persons from Sri Lanka\u2019s Northern Province into Rameswaram on Tuesday has triggered a debate on whether they can be accorded the refugee status.The immigrants - three men, six women and seven children - cited economic crisis in their country as the reason for their action. But persons who are in the know of international law say this cannot be a ground for providing refugee status. Ordinarily, a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion is regarded as a refugee under the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which, along with the 1967 Protocol, forms the foundation of international law on refugees. Despite not ratifying the Convention and the Protocol, India had provided shelter to around three lakh Tamils who fled Sri Lanka in the wake of the 1983 Black July, when anti-Tamil riots broke out in that country. Since 2012, India has not granted the status of refugee to anyone arriving from Sri Lanka, after the civil war ended in May 2009. Currently, there are around 90,000 camp and non-camp refugees in the State.Sources say the \u201cillegal migrants\u201d are now in police custody. The government is investigating whether some of them were earlier regarded as refugees, and whether they had taken \u201cexit visas\u201d at the time of leaving rehabilitation camps. Inquiries revealed that four of the 16 persons left the Gudiyatham rehabilitation camp in 2016, after taking the exit visas, and they returned to Sri Lanka with the assistance of the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). A few others were said to have stayed at a camp in Erode district. Sources point out that just because they availed themselves of exit visas before leaving the country, they cannot claim the refugee status again.An official in the State government says there has been no word from the Central government on how to deal with the 16 illegal migrants, in the light of the current economic crisis in Sri Lanka. While citing the international legal position on refugees, M. Parivelan, Associate Professor at School of Law, Rights and Constitutional Governance, and Chairperson of the Centre for Statelessness and Refugee Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, however, calls for a \u201chumane approach\u201d. India can make \u201cspecial provisions to give temporary asylum\u201d and financial support to them. The fact that Tamils have faced the \u201cdouble impact\u201d of the economic issues and the civil war/post-war situation needs to be considered, he points out."

This year we will definitely have results,\u201d Chiu said. Some in Taiwan have suggested the four-month compulsory military service should be longer.In recent years, China has stepped up its military harassment of the self-ruled island, which China claims as its own territory, sending fighter jets flying toward Taiwan on a near-daily basis. Taiwan and China split during a civil war in 1949.Many experts have drawn comparisons of the Taiwan-China situation to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February. However, the situation does not fit a simple narrative and experts have so far said military action from China is unlikely. The war in Ukraine did prompt a lawmaker from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan to publicly say it is \u201cnecessary\u201d to extend the mandatory service period.Russia's war against Ukraine has drawn sympathy in Taiwan, where the public raised more than $10.6 million in five days to help fund Ukrainian refugee relief efforts. Taiwan has more than 2,15,000 members in its military, with the majority being volunteers. Taiwanese men over the age of 18 are required to serve for four months in the military."

Ms. Truss also announced that two other citizens \u2014 Anoosheh Ashoori and Morad Tahbaz had been released by the Iranian government. However, only one \u2014 Mr. Ashoori \u2014 could return to the UK.\u00a0Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, 43, is a dual citizen of Iran and the United Kingdom. Born in the Iranian capital Tehran, she studied English literature and went on to become an English teacher. In 2003, the massive earthquake in Iran prompted her turn toward aid-work. She joined the Japanese International Cooperation Agency as a relief worker. Later, she worked with the International Federation of Red Cross, the Red Crescent Societies, and the World Health Organization, where she assumed the position of a communications officer.In 2007, she moved to the UK on a scholarship at the London Metropolitan University to study communications management. She married Richard Ratcliffe in 2009.In 2011, she started working with the Thomson Reuters Foundation (THF), an organisation advocating for human rights and freedom of speech and expression, first as a project worker and then a project manager. Prior to joining THF, she also worked with BBC Media Action, an international development charity. In 2014, her daughter Gabriella was born, after which Ms. Ratcliffe would visit her family in Iran more often \u2014 twice a year, as per her husband, Mr. Ratcliffe.In March 2016, Ms. Ratcliffe had flown to Iran with her daughter Gabriella, who was almost two years old at the time, to celebrate the Iranian New Year with her family. In April, when she was at the Imam Khomeini Airport to return to the UK, members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard arrested her, saying that she was behind a \"foreign-linked hostile network\". Both THF and BBC Media Action said that she was on a holiday in Iran and not working for the duration of her visit. She was subsequently subjected to two months of rigorous interrogation and in September 2016 sentenced to five years in prison by the Iran Revolutionary Court, which accused her of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government. However, the official charges and evidence against her were never made public. She has always denied the charges against her. Her daughter Gabriella, who was living with her grandparents in Tehran after Ms. Ratcliffe\u2019s arrest, was returned to her father in the UK in 2019. The aid-worker spent four years of her sentence at the Evin prison in Tehran. Of this, the first nine months were spent in solitary confinement, according to The Guardian. Her family had alleged that she was subjected to mental and physical torture in prison. The last year of her sentence was spent in house arrest in her parents\u2019 home in Iran, as prisoners were released on parole owing to the Coronavirus pandemic. As her sentence expired in 2021, in April of the same year she was charged with spreading \u201cpropaganda\u201d against the Iranian government, sentenced to another year in prison and handed a one-year travel ban by the court. Her lawyer, Hojjat Kermani, had said that Ms. Ratcliffe was charged for participating in a demonstration in London outside the Iranian embassy 12 years ago, aside from giving an interview to the BBC Persian service. British Human Rights organisation Amnesty International had called her trial \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d and her imprisonment unjust and arbitrary. During her time in prison, Ms. Radcliffe went on two hunger strikes in 2019. She first started a three-day strike for being denied essential medical treatment and then undertook a 15-day hunger strike for her unconditional release. Two British administrations, through their respective terms, made diplomatic efforts at bringing her back to the country. The British Embassy could not represent her in court, as Iran does not recognise dual citizenship. In 2018, former Foreign Secretary of the UK, Jeremy Hunt had said after a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif, that it was \"not acceptable to detain innocent people arbitrarily at the cost of enormous human anguish\". The then Prime Minister of the UK, Theresa May, had met Iranian president Hassan Rouhani for talks at the United Nations in 2018, and conveyed \"serious concerns\" about Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe's imprisonment, calling for her release. Ms. Ratcliffe\u2019s detention had also become a foreign policy issue for the current Boris Johnson administration, which was criticised for impeding the progress of the release efforts. Before becoming the Prime Minister, when Mr. Johnson was serving as the British Foreign Secretary, and he had said in a 2017 statement condemning Ms. Ratcliffe\u2019s imprisonment that she was \u201csimply teaching people journalism'' in Iran. This statement, despite being retracted by him later, was used as proof in the Iranian court that she was engaging in propaganda activities. Ms. Ratcliffe\u2019s family, especially her husband, frequently said during her imprisonment that she was being used as a \u201cpolitical pawn\u201d, alleging that she was being held in Tehran because the British government had not repaid an age-old \u00a3400 million defence debt to the Iranian government. In the 1970s, before the Iranian revolution, the Shah of Iran, who was an ally of the UK, had ordered 1,500 Chieftain tanks and over 200 armoured vehicles, making an upfront payment to the UK. However, only a fraction of the defence equipment was delivered to Iran before the Shah was ousted, and the remaining principal amount was not repaid by the British. According to Mr. Ratcliffe, his wife had been told by the captors that her arrest was connected to the UK not paying back the debt.While both Iranian and British governments denied that the two events were connected, former British Foreign Secretary Mr. Hunt had said in 2021 that Iran was linking the debt to Ms. Ratcliffe\u2019s case. \"I think they [Iran] are trying to use this as leverage to settle the historic debt for the Chieftain tanks and that's what they want settled. We obviously reject any linkage because we don't want to encourage hostage diplomacy and we want to follow the legal processes,\u2019 he had said. Political observers say the linkage was further strengthened owing to a statement made by the current Foriegn Secretary of the UK, Liz Truss, at the time of Ms. Ratcliffe\u2019s release. Incidentally, on March 16, the day of the aid-worker\u2019s release, Ms. Truss had announced that after \"highly complex\" negotiations, the UK had found a way to clear the \u00a3393.8 million debt with Iran, with existing sanctions against Iran, anti-terror financing rules and anti-money laundering rules in place. She added that Iran would only be allowed to use the funds for humanitarian work. Simultaneously with Ms. Ratcliffe, two other citizens were also released by Iranian authorities. Anoosheh Ashoori, 67, a British-Iranian businessman, who had earned his educational qualifications and expanded his business in the UK, lived in Iran between 1982 and 2005. In 2017, when he travelled to Iran to meet his mother, he was arrested by the authorities and in 2019, sentenced to 12 years in prison. Of this, 10 years were prescribed for charges of \u201cspying for Israel\u2019s Mossad\u201d and two years for \u201cacquiring illegitimate wealth\u201d. Mr. Ashoori too, has always denied the accusations against him. Mr. Ashoori also went on a hunger strike in the Evin Prison in Tehran for 17 days. In 2020, his wife, Sherry Izadi had said that he had attempted suicide twice in prison. Amnesty International UK has alleged that he was tortured and illegally made to sign confessions. Mr. Ashoori was released on March 16 and reached the UK along with Ms. Ratcliffe. A third prisoner, British-Iranian-American citizen Morad Tahbaz was also released from prison simultaneously, but could not come back to the UK as Iran intends to hold separate negotiations with America due to his US citizenship. Mr. Tahbaz, a businessman and conservationist, had co-founded the wildlife conservation group Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation (PWHF). In 2018, he was arrested in Iran and accused of spying, after he and his group were \u201ctracking\u201d endangered species using cameras. The group was researching endangered animals such as the Asiatic cheetah in Iran. Tehran said that Mr. Tahbaz and his group were gathering classified information under the guise of scientific and environmental projects. In late 2019, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for having \u201ccontacts with the US enemy government\u201d. Amnesty International has described him as a \u201cprisoner of conscience\u201d and said that there was evidence that he was tortured in confinement. "

        "title": "\nA new fund directs its support to Ukraine's long-term needs\n",
        "text": "The humanitarian needs of more than 10 million displaced Ukrainians have quickly become staggering. Yet Mark Malloch-Brown, president of the Open Society Foundations, warns that longer-term problems resulting from Russia's invasion will grow ever larger if they aren't sufficiently addressed now.Experts report an \u201cunprecedented\u201d outpouring of aid for food, medicine and other essential needs of Ukrainians. Comparatively few donations, though, have been earmarked for maintaining Ukraine's culture or democratic foundations.To address that cause, Open Society Foundations has launched the Ukraine Democracy Fund with a $25 million pledge, in hopes of raising $100 million. The foundations, launched by billionaire investor George Soros, are now one of the world's largest funders of democracy, human rights and justice groups.Malloch-Brown, who has also served as the United Nations deputy secretary general, said, \u201cKeeping their civil society alive absolutely is the key bit. Otherwise, it\u2019s a hollow victory. If you neglect or lose that civil society piece, you\u2019ve lost what this was ultimately all about.\u201dSince Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, the philanthropy research organisation Candid has catalogued $440 million in grants and $333 million more in pledges for the victims. Those totals do not, however, include individual donations or donations from nonprofits and corporations that haven't yet publicly reported their gifts, meaning that the actual amount of aid is much higher.\u201cBy many measures, this has been an unprecedented philanthropic response by organisations, by individuals,\u201d said Laia Grino, Candid\u2019s director of data discovery. \u201cSome groups have said that this has exceeded what they were able to raise for COVID-19, what they raised for racial equity, the response to the crisis in Afghanistan.\"Ms. Grino noted that the bulk of those donations are for immediate needs \u2014 food, shelter, safety. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a lot for longer-term efforts really,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that will continue to be important.\u201d Malloch-Brown says Open Society has supported Ukraine with about $230 million in donations since the nation declared its independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991.\u201cThe $230 million has been primarily invested in developing the sort of civil society and democratic space that has made Ukraine so different from Russia,\u201d Malloch-Brown said. \u201cOur feeling is that [Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s] real target is exactly these values our investment represented and sought to build because that\u2019s what threatens him \u2014 this sort of gloriously humorous, ironic, open, vigorous, debating world of Ukraine versus his locked-down, common, homogeneous values of Russia.\u201d\u201cOpen Society believes its history within Ukraine and its contacts in the country are tools that must be used to keep the nation\u2019s culture intact \u201cby continuing to invest in human rights defenders and journalism and the civil society, which sustain the country\u2019s democracy,\u201d Malloch-Brown said.\u201cIt plans to continue to fund independent media throughout the war and to support journalists and scholars who are documenting war crimes or providing public health information.\u201d\u201cWe recognise that it\u2019s going to be harder and harder as the Russian military crackdown intensifies,\u201d Malloch-Brown said. \u201cA lot of people will be displaced \u2014 some into exile, some in the west of the country \u2014 but we\u2019ve got to follow them and enable them to keep working and fighting for those values that they\u2019ve been fighting to build for so many years.\u201dIn two weeks, Open Society\u2019s Ukraine Democracy Fund raised an additional $13 million from the Ford Foundation, the Oak Foundation, the Schmidt Family Foundation and other, anonymous donors.\u201cPhilanthropy can and should anticipate what and where ongoing needs will be and step in preemptively to address them,\u201d Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, wrote in a statement. \u201cThis crisis calls out for America to rise to the challenge and realise our promise \u2014 not just despite our missteps in recent years, but because of them.\u201dAfter all, Malloch-Brown said, there are plenty of compelling reasons to rally around Ukraine. \u201cUkraine is a story about democratic success, not failure,\u201d he said. \u201cOne can\u2019t find many silver linings to this horrific situation, but under Volodymyr Zelenskyy, it was becoming this glorious, New York-like hodgepodge of opinions and views \u2014 a real rainbow of pluralism.\u201d"

        "text": " In a surprise decision the hardline leadership of Afghanistan\u2019s new rulers decided against opening educational institutions to girls beyond Grade 6, a Taliban official said on March 23 on the first day of Afghanistan\u2019s new school year.The latest setback for girls education is certain to receive widespread condemnation from the international community that has been urging the Taliban leaders to open schools and give women their right to public space.The unexpected decision came late on March 22 as Afghanistan\u2019s Education Ministry prepared for the new year opening of school, which was expected to herald the return of girls to school. A statement by the Ministry earlier in the week urged \u201call students\u201d to come to school.However the decision to postpone a return of girls going to school in higher levels appeared to be a concession to the rural and deeply tribal backbone of the hardline Taliban movement, that in many parts of the countryside are reluctant to send their daughters to school.Girls have been banned from school beyond Grade 6 in most of the country since the Taliban returned to power in mid-August. Universities opened up earlier this year in much of the country, but since taking power the Taliban edicts have been erratic and while a handful of Provinces continued to provide education to all, most provinces closed educational institutions for girls and women.In the capital Kabul private schools and universities have operated uninterrupted.The religiously-driven Taliban administration fears going forward with enrolling girls beyond Grade 6 could erode their base, said Waheedullah Hashmi, external relations and donor representative with the Taliban-led administration.\u201cThe leadership hasn\u2019t decided when or how they will allow girls to return to school,\u201d Hashmi said.While he accepted that urban centres are mostly supportive of girls education, much of rural Afghanistan is opposed, particularly in tribal Pashtun regions.In some rural areas a brother will disown a brother in the city if he finds out that he is letting his daughters go to school,\u201d said Hashimi, who said the Taliban leadership is trying to decide how to open education for girls beyond Grade 6 countrywide.Most Taliban are ethnic Pashtuns. In their sweep through the country last year, other ethnics groups such as Uzbeks and Tajiks in the north of the country either joined the fight to give the Taliban their victory or simply chose not to fight.\u201cWe did everything the Taliban asked in terms of Islamic dress and they promised that girls could go to school and now they have broken their promise,\u201d said Mariam Naheebi, a local journalist who spoke to the Associated Press in the Afghan capital. Ms. Naheebi has protested for women\u2019s rights and says \u201cthey have not been honest with us\u201d."

        "text": "Protesters in Jamaica, donning T-shirts emblasoned with a pair of shackled Black wrists surrounded by the phrases \u201cSeh Yuh Sorry!\u201d and \u201cApologize now!\u201d, raised their fists on March 22, as they demonstrated just hours before Prince William and Kate arrived.The protest in front of the British High Commission in Kingston comes a couple of days after dozens of prominent leaders in Jamaica publicised a letter demanding that Britain apologise and award its former colony slavery reparations. They also decried the week-long Central American and Caribbean tour that the Duke and the Duchess of Cambridge embarked on Saturday, which coincides with Jamaica\u2019s 60th independence anniversary and the 70th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s coronation.\u201cKings, Queens, and Princesses and Princes belong in fairytales, NOT in Jamaica!\u201d read one poster held aloft by a young girl who joined the protest. The royal couple's trip, which began with a stop in Belize, followed by scheduled visits to Jamaica and the Bahamas, was organised at the queen\u2019s behest as some countries debate cutting ties to the monarchy like Barbados did in November.Mike Henry, a veteran Jamaican lawmaker, said in a phone interview that while the topic has been discussed, he worries that demands for an apology and reparations would be rendered moot if the island stopped pledging allegiance to the queen. Maziki Thame, a senior lecturer at the University of the West Indies, noted that Jamaicans have been seeking reparations for decades.\u201cThis is not a new cause,\u201d she said in a phone interview as she prepared to join the protest. \u201cThe question is whether it will get any traction...whether the British are ready to contend with their history.\u201dThe British empire controlled Jamaica for more than 300 years and forced hundreds of thousands of African slaves to toil the island under brutal conditions. Sugar replaced tobacco and cocoa as the main crop, with some 430 sugar estates reported by the mid-1700s, up from 57 nearly a century prior, according to Jamaica Information Services, a government agency.The group protesting the royal visit noted in its letter that the British raped and killed thousands of slaves as it sought an apology for 60 reasons, including \u201cfor refusing to acknowledge the historic trade in Africans as a crime against humanity,\u201d and for \u201cpretending that the British led the abolition movement, when our ancestors worked, prayed and fought hard for this.\u201dMs. Thame, the university professor, said she and many other Jamaicans are not celebrating what is known as the queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t speak to us in the way they might imagine that speaks to us,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the 20th century, Jamaicans have moved beyond celebrating the crown.\u201dPrince William and Kate are scheduled to spend two days in Jamaica, where they\u2019re expected to meet with government officials and tour Trench Town, the gritty birthplace of rocksteady and reggae where Bob Marley grew up. Ahead of their trip, Jamaican singer Beenie Man told TV show Good Morning Britain that the U. K. still controls the commonwealth of Jamaica: \u201cIt\u2019s all about the Queen, and the Queen serve and the Queen this and that \u2013 but what are they doing for Jamaica? They\u2019re not doing anything for us.\"The monarchy has said that Britain and Jamaica have a strong trade relationship, with the island exporting goods including rum and raw cane sugar to the U. K. It also noted the creation of programmes targeting poverty, security, natural disaster management, social issues and the economy.An estimated 55,000 British citizens live in Jamaica, while some 8,00,000 people of Jamaican descent live in the United Kingdom. The relationship between the two countries soured in recent years after some Caribbean people who had long lived in Britain legally were denied jobs, housing or medical care, with some deported because they didn't have the required paperwork. Britain has since apologised and pledged compensation."

        "text": "Two Missionaries of Charity nuns from the northeastern state of Mizoram who refused to leave Ukraine and remain in the war-torn nation\u2019s capital are safe with the homeless they are looking after but running short of food and unable to move out of their temporary shelter.Sister Rosela Nuthangi (65), from Sihphir village, about 15 km north of Aizawl, and Sister Ann Frida (48) from Aizawl's Electric Veng locality along with three sisters from other nations are currently looking after 37 homeless Ukrainians and a student from Kerala in a storehouse (godown) in Kyiv and remain determined to continue with their work in Ukraine, their relatives said.Sylveen Zothansiami, niece of Rosela, told PTI that her aunt and Sister Frida were safe and sound but on the verge of a food shortage. She said that she managed to speak to them over the phone on Monday.\"We are fine and still have food to eat as we hoarded them before. We can't move outside and now hiding in a storehouse,\" Sylveen quoted Sister Rosela as saying.Sylveen said that Sisters Rosela and Frida along with 3 other Sisters were caring for 37 homeless Ukrainians inside the packed storehouse. Recently, they were joined by a student from Kerala, who managed to find shelter with them when Russia launched an intensive attack on the city.Although Sister Rosela was earlier able to procure essential supplies secretly, the fear of shortages loom large as the war and bombings drag on, Sylveen said. \u201cThey are now eating economically \u2026 they are not sure whether they will continue getting supplies brought in by fathers from other missions,\u201d she said.She said that the advent of the student from Kerala has been a great help as they are able to make calls and talk to family using his mobile phone.Sister Frida's brother Robert Lalhruaitluanga also said that her elder sister told them not to worry when they managed to communicate on Monday.\"My sister told us not to worry about them. They are happy despite the hardships they face because of the ongoing war,\" he told PTI.Earlier, Sisters Rosela and Frida defied a request to move to a safer place and chose to stay on in a war-torn Ukraine risking their lives to continue serving refugees and injured people who had sheltered with them.\"We refused to leave Ukraine because serving the needy and the homeless in all seasons is one of our primary commitments,\" Robert quoted Sister Frida as saying.Sister Rosela joined the Missionaries of Charity in 1981 and was sent to the former Soviet Union (USSR) as a missionary in 1991. She worked in Moscow for 10 years.The sixth daughter of 8 sisters, Sister Rosela has mastery over the Russian language and has worked in a number of former Soviet counties including Latvia and Estonia, before moving to Ukraine in 2013, Sylveen said.She said that her aunt returned to their village only on two occasions in 2009 and 2015 since moving to the USSR.Her last visit to Mizoram was to attend the ordination ceremony of her cousin Father Alwyn Zothansanga, who died in 2020 due to COVID-19, she said.Sister Frida, who joined the MoC in 1995 and after working in India for a few years, went as a missionary to several countries including Lithuania, Siberia and Armenia, according to Robert.The nun moved to Ukraine in 2019 and is still serving there, Robert said.

        "text": "The search for clues into why a Chinese commercial jetliner dove suddenly and crashed into a mountain in southern China was suspended on March 23, as rain slickened the debris field and filled the red-dirt gash formed by the plane\u2019s fiery impact.Earlier, searchers had used hand tools, drones and sniffer dogs under rainy conditions to comb the heavily forested slopes for the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, as well as any human remains. Crews also worked to pump water from the pit created when the plane hit the ground, but their efforts were suspended around mid-morning because small landslides were possible on the steep, slick slopes.Video clips posted by China\u2019s state media showed small pieces of the Boeing 737-800 plane scattered over the area. Mud-stained wallets, bank and identity cards have also been recovered. Each piece of debris has a number next to it, the larger ones marked off by police tape. China Eastern Flight 5735 was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew from Kunming in Yunnan province to Guangzhou, an industrial centre on China\u2019s southeastern coast, when it crashed on Monday afternoon outside the city of Wuzhou in the Guangxi region. All 132 people on board are presumed killed.\u201cInvestigators say it is too early to speculate on the cause. The plane went into an unexplained dive an hour after departure and stopped transmitting data 96 seconds into the fall. An air-traffic controller tried to contact the pilots several times after seeing the plane\u2019s altitude drop sharply, but got no reply, a grim-faced Zhu Tao, director of the Office of Aviation Safety at the Civil Aviation Authority of China,\u201d said at a Tuesday evening news conference. \u201cAs of now, the rescue has yet to find survivors,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cThe public security department has taken control of the site.\u201dChina Eastern is headquartered in Shanghai and is one of China\u2019s three largest carriers with more than 600 planes, including 109 Boeing 737-800s. China's Transport Ministry said China Eastern has grounded all of its 737-800s, a move that could further disrupt domestic air travel already curtailed because of the largest COVID-19 outbreak in China since the initial peak in early 2020. The Boeing 737-800 has been flying since 1998 and has a well-established safety record. It is an earlier model than the 737 Max, which was grounded worldwide for nearly two years after deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019.Monday's crash was China's worst in more than a decade. In August 2010, an Embraer ERJ 190-100 operated by Henan Airlines hit the ground short of the runway in the northeastern city of Yichun and caught fire. It carried 96 people and 44 of them died. Investigators blamed pilot error."

The United States and its Western allies are assessing whether Russia should remain within the Group of Twenty (G20) grouping of major economies following its invasion of Ukraine, sources involved in the discussions told Reuters.Ukrainian leaders accused Russia of seizing 15 rescue workers and drivers from a humanitarian convoy trying to get desperately needed food and other supplies into the bloodied port city of Mariupol, which also came under naval attack after weeks of air and land strikes.\rUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy estimated that 100,000 civilians remained in Mariupol, scene of some of the war's worst devastation, as Russia presses a nearly month-old offensive by bombarding cities and towns. Those made it out described a shattered city. - APNational flag carrier Vietnam Airlines will temporarily suspend regular flights from Hanoi to Moscow starting from March 25 until further notice, the state run Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported on Wednesday.\rThe suspension was to review procedures, requirements and regulations related to flight operations in Russia, VNA reported. The two countries have close ties dating back to the Soviet era and Vietnam has not so far condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. - Reuters"

Mr. Mullin, a former Labour MP and Minister in Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, wrote a book that helped secure the release of six men wrongly convicted of the atrocity.During research, the real bomber made a \"full confession\" to him, a court hearing in London was told last month. But the author promised never to reveal his identity.In a ruling, judge Mark Lucraft backed Mr. Mullin, who was supported in the case by the National Union of Journalists, and said he did not have to hand over his notes to police.He said there was no \"overriding public interest to displace the journalistic source protection right\" under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\"I decline to grant the production order sought,\" he added.Mr. Mullin, 74, said afterwards: \"The right of a journalist to protect his or her sources is fundamental to a free press in a democracy.\"He has previously accused the police of failing to conduct a proper investigation.If they had done, he argued, \"they may have caught the real perpetrators in the first place\".Mr. Mullin's lawyer, Louis Charalambous, said the ruling was \"a landmark\" for freedom of expression, and recognised the public interest of exposing a miscarriage of justice.\"If a confidential source cannot rely on a journalist's promise of lifelong protection then these investigations will never see the light of day,\" he added.NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet said the ruling vindicated Mr. Mullin's \"courageous\" and \"dogged\" reporting.\"This case threatened press freedom and amounted to another attempt to criminalise the legitimate actions of journalists,\" she added.The so-called Birmingham Six spent 17 years in jail and were released in 1991.West Midlands Police said it would now \"consider carefully\" the judgment."

With Russia's military appearing to make little headway in capturing key targets, fears are growing that Mr. Putin may resort to even more drastic means to turn the tide. U.S. President Joe Biden warned that Mr. Putin was considering using chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine as he held talks with European leaders on Monday on what he called Moscow's increasingly \"brutal tactics\".The U.S. leader is due to travel to Brussels on Thursday for a series of summits gathering NATO, EU and G7 leaders, before heading to Poland, which has received the bulk of the three million Ukrainians fleeing war in their country.Since Russia launched its invasion on February 24, at least 117 children have been killed in the war, Ukraine's federal prosecutor said.Some 548 schools have been damaged, including 72 completely destroyed.But both Western and Ukrainian experts believe the war was not going the way the Kremlin had expected.Moscow has stepped up its military activity, flying 300 sorties in the past 24 hours, in a \"desperate\" bid to turn the tide against the Ukrainian resistance, a senior U.S. defence official said.Ukraine's army command said Russian troops now had ammunition, food and fuel to last just three days.Three hundred Russian soldiers have defected in the north-eastern Sumy region, added the army command on Facebook. But even in areas Russia has captured, resistance has continued, with Ukraine's leaders on Tuesday accusing Russian troops of firing on unarmed protesters in the occupied southern city of Kherson.A series of videos posted on social media and the messaging app Telegram showed citizens gathering in Kherson's \"Freedom Square\" protesting against Russia's recent seizure of the city.Russian soldiers could be seen firing into the air, and video footage showing a bleeding elderly man being carried away, though local officials said there were no fatalities.On the frontlines, authorities said evacuation of residents from Mariupol will be the priority on Tuesday. Three routes have been drawn up linking the port city to Zaporizhzhia, Ms. Vereshschuk said. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell had described as a \"massive war crime\" the siege of Mariupol, which had killed more than 2,000 people.Russia had given Mariupol until 5:00 a.m. on Monday to surrender, but Kyiv rejected the ultimatum and said the city's resistance was bolstering the defence of all of Ukraine.Mariupol is a pivotal target in Putin's war \u2014 providing a land bridge between Russian forces in Crimea to the southwest and Russian-controlled territory to the north and east.While little progress had been made from diplomatic efforts to solve the conflict, Mr. Zelensky once again renewed a call for direct discussions with his Russian counterpart.\"If I have this opportunity and Russia has the desire, we would go through all the questions,\" he told Ukrainian journalists in an interview published by media outlet Suspilne.\"Would we solve them all? No. But there is chance, that we partially could \u2014 at least to stop the war,\" he added.Mr. Zelensky said he was even willing to discuss Russian-occupied Crimea and the breakaway Russian regions in Donbas, though he insisted he still believes they must be returned to Ukraine.\"At the first meeting with the president of Russia, I am ready to raise these issues,\" he said, adding that any agreement involving \"historic\" changes would be put to a national referendum.\"This is a very difficult story for everyone. Crimea and Donbas... And to find a way out, we need to take this first step, which I spoke about: security guarantees, the end of the war,\" he said. He repeated his assertion that Ukraine \"already understood\" it could not join NATO, but he added that his countrymen would not simply \"hand over\" the capital, the eastern city of Kharkiv, or the heavily bombarded and besieged southern port of Mariupol.\"Ukraine cannot fulfil Russian ultimatums,\" he said. \"We should be destroyed first.\" In Kyiv, a 35-hour curfew came into effect from 8:00 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Monday, after Russian strikes laid waste to the \"Retroville\" shopping complex, killing at least eight persons.\"It's the biggest bomb to have hit the city until now,\" said 30-year-old Dima Stepanienko, who found himself flung to \"the foot of his bed\" by the explosion.Russia claimed the mall was being used to store rocket systems and ammunition.The war has displaced around 10 million Ukrainians, with around a third becoming refugees, according to the UN, and sparked fears of famine elsewhere because Russia and Ukraine are both major agricultural exporters.To help Ukraine cope with the economic devastation of war, EU leaders are looking at setting up a \"trust fund\" for the country, according to a draft document seen by AFP Tuesday.The funds would \"provide support to the Ukrainian Government for its immediate needs and, once the Russian onslaught has ceased, for the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine.\""

China\u2019s deployment of \u201cnecessary national defense facilities on its own territory is a right entitled to every sovereign country and is in line with international law, which is beyond reproach,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters at a daily briefing.

John C. Aquilino said China had armed the islands with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile systems, laser and jamming equipment, and fighter jets, in an increasingly aggressive move that threatens all nations operating nearby.Adm. Aquilino said the hostile actions were in stark contrast to Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s past assurances that Beijing would not transform the artificial islands in contested waters into military bases. The efforts were part of China's flexing of its military muscle, he said.\u201cI think over the past 20 years we\u2019ve witnessed the largest military buildup since World War II by the PRC,\u201d Adm. Aquilino told The Associated Press in an interview, using the initials of China\u2019s formal name. \u201cThey have advanced all their capabilities and that buildup of weaponization is destabilizing to the region.\u201dChina claims as its own territory virtually the entire South China Sea, home to fish stocks and undersea minerals, along with sea lanes through which an estimated $5 trillion in global trade travels each year. China refuses to acknowledge claims from five other governments to some or all of the waterway and dismissed the findings of a UN-backed arbitration tribunal that invalidated China\u2019s sweeping historical claims under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.The fully militarised islands are among seven China has constructed in recent years by piling sand and concrete atop coral reefs, causing heavy damage to the marine environment.

The CPC has over 1,000 fuel stations across the island. \u00a0Military participation in civilian functions has remained a sensitive issue in post-war Sri Lanka, especially in the Tamil-majority north and east where army personnel can be frequently spotted, at times even regulating traffic. The army has been involved in agriculture, and more recently in the country\u2019s pandemic response. Sri Lanka\u2019s army chief General Shavendra Silva led a task force on COVID-19 and was later appointed to oversee the \u2018Green Agriculture Operative Centre\u2019, set up by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The UN Human Rights Chief has raised concern over the appointment of past and present military officials to bureaucratic positions. The army will now also oversee fuel distribution across the country, amid a persisting short supply. Long rows of vehicles have become a common sight outside fuel stations. Over the past few days, at least four senior citizens died reportedly while waiting in queues. Local media also reported on clashes among customers at some fuel stations. According to a recent media statement by CPC Chairman Sumith Wijesinghe, the daily demand \u2014 before the shortages \u2014 was about 5,500 metric tonnes of diesel and 3,300 metric tonnes of petrol. \u201cNow due to excess buying, we have been issuing 7,000-8,000 MT of diesel and 4,200-4,500 MT of Petrol from CPC storage to the market in the past few days,\u201d he said. The disruption in Sri Lanka\u2019s fuel supply is only one manifestation of the island nation\u2019s rapid economic downturn over the last few months, with the pandemic severely impacting its foreign exchange generating sectors. The consequent dollar crunch has stalled the import of essentials, including food, fuel, and medicines. The Sri Lankan rupee fell further on Tuesday, to 272.06 to a U.S. dollar, or nearly 3.7 to \u20b9 1, while the prices of basic items from milk powder and rice, to dal and coconut, are soaring. Citizens\u2019 groups and the political opposition have been protesting in different locations, blaming the government for the state of the country\u2019s economy. \u00a0Sri Lanka obtained an Indian credit line for $ 500 million to cover emergency fuel supplies and has so far received two consignments of fuel from India that, authorities here expect, will ease the shortage.

Some countries, including Germany, say the bloc is too dependent on Russia's fossil fuels to withstand such a step.\"It is still not clear whether this will really happen,\" wrote Carsten Fritsch of Commerzbank in a report, adding: \"a decision of this kind requires unanimity.\"Brent crude rose 13 cents, or 0.1%, to $115.75 a barrel by 1326 GMT.

Both contracts had settled up more than 7% on Monday.Oil was pressured by a stronger U.S. dollar, which gained after comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Monday that flagged a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy than previously anticipated.A strong dollar makes crude more expensive for other currency holders and tends to weigh on risk appetite.\"The word 'transitory' regarding inflation is a distant memory, chiefly due to rising commodity prices,\" said Tamas Varga of broker PVM. \"Central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, stand ready to increase the cost of borrowing significantly.\"Brent hit $139 a barrel, the highest since 2008, earlier this month. Threats to supply from attacks by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group on Saudi energy and water desalination facilities added support.Saudi Arabia said on Monday it would not bear responsibility for any global supply shortages after the attacks by the Houthis, in a sign of growing Saudi frustration with Washington's handling of Yemen and Iran.In focus later will be the latest round of U.S. inventory data, which analysts expect to show no change in crude oil stocks.

How that transpires into how much oil is lost, is still relatively unknown,\" Mr. Hardy said.\"We think 2-3 million bpd of Russian oil could be lost but a lot depends on Asia's reaction.\"Any replacement oil is likely to be months away. Iran could increase exports by 1 million bpd provided a nuclear deal is signed, but the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies were unlikely to increase output faster, he said.\"They've been fairly clear up till now that they will continue with their OPEC+ agreement,\" Mr. Hardy said, adding African countries in particular had less oil to spare than before the pandemic.\"Are we expecting a 1-2 mln bpd increase? Yes but not likely in next couple of months,\" he said.The futures markets, for natural gas in particular, have become more prone to volatility as strained credit lines force market participants to cut positions.\"Gas markets are even more concerning than oil. It's important for regulators to have the tools in their back pocket in case there is disorder in the gas market,\" Mr. Hardy said, pointing to extreme jumps in benchmark European wholesale gas futures.He said diesel supplies were also of particular concern as half Europe's imports come from Russia, with rationing a possibility."

        "text": "Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was convicted of fraud and contempt of court and sentenced to nine years in a maximum security prison on Tuesday.A judge also ruled that Navalny would have to pay a fine of 1.2 million rubles (about $11,500).Navalny is currently serving another prison sentence of 2 1/2 years in a prison colony east of Moscow. His associates have said the new trial was intended to keep Navalny, President Vladimir Putin\u2019s longtime foe, behind bars for as long as possible.The prosecution accuses him of embezzling money that he and his foundation raised over the years and of insulting a judge during a previous trial. Navalny has rejected the allegations as politically motivated. The trial, which opened about a month ago, unfolded in a makeshift courtroom in the prison colony hours away from Moscow where Navalny is serving a sentence for parole violations. Navalny\u2019s supporters have criticized the authorities\u2019 decision to move the proceedings there from a courthouse in Moscow, saying it has effectively limited access to the proceedings for the media and supporters. Navalny, 45, has appeared at hearings wearing prison garb and made several elaborate speeches during the trial, decrying the charges against him as bogus. Navalny was arrested in January 2021 immediately upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months convalescing from a poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin, a claim Russian officials vehemently denied. Shortly after the arrest, a court sentenced him to 2 1/2 years in prison over the parole violations stemming from a 2014 suspended sentence in a fraud case that Navalny insists was politically driven.Following Navalny\u2019s imprisonment, authorities unleashed a sweeping crackdown on his associates and supporters. His closest allies have left Russia after facing multiple criminal charges, and his Foundation for Fighting Corruption and a network of nearly 40 regional offices were outlawed as extremist \u2014 a designation that exposes people involved to prosecution. Last month, Russian officials added Navalny and a number of his associates to a state registry of extremists and terrorists.Several criminal cases have been launched against Navalny individually, leading his associates to suggest the Kremlin intends to keep him behind bars for as long as possible.

Ukraine has always been one of\nthe largest food exporters, but how can we sow (crops) under the strikes of Russian artillery?\"Countries such as Lebanon, Egypt, Yemen and others have come to rely on Ukrainian wheat in recent years and the war has caused wheat prices to skyrocket - rising by 50% in the last month.Russian President Vladimir Putin calls the war, the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, a \"special\nmilitary operation\" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from \"Nazis\". The West calls that a false pretext for an unprovoked\nwar of aggression.Replying to Mr Zelenskiy, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said that Ukraine had offered \"heroic\" resistance to the Russian invasion and promised continued support for refugees fleeing the fighting, as well as military aid.\"The arrogance of the Russian government has collided with the dignity of the Ukrainian people, who have managed to curb Moscow's expansionist aims and impose a huge cost on the invading army,\" Mr Draghi told parliament.Signalling its desire to strengthen ties with the West, Ukraine has long said it wants to join the European Union.Draghi told lawmakers that this was a lengthy process because of the many reforms needed to integrate fully with the\n27-nation bloc.\"I want to say to President Zelenskiy that Italy is at Ukraine's side in this process.

        "text": "A drive to vaccinate more than nine million children against polio has been launched this week in four countries in southern and eastern Africa after an outbreak was confirmed in Malawi.The urgent vaccination campaign has started in Malawi where drops of the inoculation are being placed in the mouths of children across the country, including in the capital, Lilongwe and the country's largest city, Blantyre. The vaccination campaign will be expanded on Thursday to include the neighbouring countries of Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia, according to UNICEF which is working with the governments and other partners. Three more rounds of vaccinations will follow in the coming months with a goal of reaching more than 20 million children. \u201cThis is the first case of wild polio detected in Africa for more than five years and UNICEF is working closely with governments and partners to do everything possible to stop the virus in its tracks,\u201d says Mohamed M. Fall, UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa. \u201cPolio spreads fast and can kill or cause permanent paralysis,\u201d he said. UNICEF, the World Health Organization and other partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative are supporting governments with the vaccination drive after it was confirmed in February that a three-year-old girl was paralysed by wild poliovirus in Malawi's capital, Lilongwe. People most commonly contract polio when they drink water contaminated by the faeces of someone who carries the virus. Children under the age of five and those living in areas with poor sanitation are most at risk. \u201cA regional response is vital as polio is extremely contagious and can spread easily as people move across borders,\u201d says Mohamed M. Fall. \u201cThere is no cure for polio, but the vaccine protects children for life. We are working with the World Health Organization and other partners to make sure parents, as well as community and religious leaders, know how important it is that every child receives their vaccine.\u201dUNICEF has procured more than 36 million doses of the polio vaccine for the first two rounds of the immunisations of children in Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. In Malawi, UNICEF is installing 270 new vaccine refrigerators, repairing other refrigerators and distributing 800 remote temperature monitoring devices, vaccine carriers and cold boxes. In partnership with the World Health Organization, UNICEF has trained 13,500 health workers and volunteers, 34 district health promotion officers and 50 faith leaders. In Mozambique, UNICEF has procured 2,500 vaccine carriers and has delivered 100 cold boxes and is assisting with the swift delivery of vaccines from national to provincial stores. UNICEF is also supporting the training of 33,000 supervisors and health workers on vaccine management and social and behavioural change, as well as training of journalists, distribution of communication materials and broadcasting radio and TV spots to support the polio campaign.In Tanzania, UNICEF has trained more than 2,000 health workers, 5,128 social mobilisers and 538 town criers, and facilitated the procurement of 3,000 vaccine carriers and 360 cold boxes, expected to be delivered in April 2022 for use in the upcoming rounds of campaigns.In Zambia, more than 200 trainers are coaching healthcare workers at the provincial and district level, with support from UNICEF and partners. District officials have been trained on polio surveillance, in partnership with the World Health Organization. "

        "text": "Japan\u2019s government alerted people of potential blackouts in the Tokyo region on March 22 because power supplies were low after several coal-fired plants temporarily stopped generating electricity, following last week's earthquake.The rare alert, calling on households and companies to conserve power, comes as the Tokyo region is facing snow and unusually cold weather for early spring, prompting the use of heaters. The magnitude-7.4 earthquake off the coast of Fukushima last Wednesday killed four people and injured more than 230 others, while reminding people of the deadly March 2011 quake and tsunami that killed thousands, triggered a nuclear disaster and devastated northeastern Japan's coast.Last week's quake caused temporary power outages, peaking at two million homes in Tokyo and eight other areas, as the coal-fired plants in the region serviced by the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings assessed and repaired damage.Power has been restored since, but the grid was being severely strained by the unusual snow and cold, officials said. By midafternoon, the conservation effort was not enough to avoid blackouts, Economy and Industry Minister Koichi Hagiuda said.Tokyo's Haneda International Airport has partially turned off lights and air-conditioning at terminals. Amusement parks and some companies in the region also switched to their backup generators to help in the conservation efforts.Tuesday marks the end of Japan\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions nationwide as infections showed signs of slowing and bars and restaurants were to return to normal service hours, but guests might have to eat in dim lights.Without further power conservation, blackouts in large areas would be inevitable, Mr. Hagiuda warned, and asked department stores, supermarkets and convenience stores to turn off neon signs and urged manufacturing factories to also conserve power as much as they can.So far, no blackouts have been reported but the utility's subsidiary, TEPCO Power Grid, said as many as three million homes could lose electricity sometime after 8 p.m."

        "title": "\nPrime Minister Imran Khan on a sticky wicket\n",
        "text": "The story so far: The all-powerful Pakistani Army appears to have withdrawn from its \u201ccoalition\u201d with Prime Minister Imran Khan, leaving him to face the March 25 no-confidence vote on his own steam. Several members of the National Assembly, known as MNAs, have already deserted the ranks of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) even as Mr. Khan plans a massive show of strength in Islamabad. The warmth between Mr. Khan and Gen. Bajwa evaporated after the Prime Minister showed a streak of independence when the Army wanted the removal of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Directorate chief Lt. General Faiz Hameed in October 2021. In theory, the choice of appointing the director-general of the ISI lies with the Prime Minister, but the Army chief is usually able to influence the appointment. Finally, Mr. Khan did the unprecedented in \u201cinterviewing\u201d three candidates for the ISI chief\u2019s job and signed off on Lt. Gen. Nadeem Anjum \u2014 the man originally appointed by Gen. Bajwa himself. Previously, the regular meetings between the Prime Minister and the Army Chief were a signal that \u201call was well\u201d between the country\u2019s permanent and political establishment as they navigated the fortunes of a new governance arrangement different from those run by the Sharifs and the Zardari clan. Mr. Khan himself was effusive in his praise for the Army chief. It is no secret in Pakistan that Gen. Bajwa had helped Mr. Khan win the 2018 general elections.The various moves by the PTI government\u2014 both on the financial and foreign policy front \u2014 would have been carefully watched by Gen. Bajwa and the rest of the army brass to assess whether these were in line with the institutional interests of the khakis. Mr. Khan has been attacking the Opposition relentlessly. His remarks against Opposition leaders like Asif Ali Zardari, Shehbaz Sharif and Fazal-ur-Rehman have been scathing \u2014 mixed with threats to send all of them to jail. He hasn\u2019t spared the Army either. A day after the Army spokesman said the institution had \u201cnothing to do with politics\u201d, the Prime Minister said at a public meeting on March 12, \u201cHumans either side with good or evil. Only animals remain neutral.\u201d The Prime Minister also said that the Army chief Gen. Bajwa had asked him not to call the Jamiat-Ulema-e-Islam (F) leader Fazal-ur-Rehman \u201cdiesel\u201d, but said it was not him (Mr. Khan), but the people that had dubbed him \u201cdiesel\u201d. (Mr. Rehman was accused of smuggling diesel for profit to Afghanistan during the 1990s). All the fighting talk may not help Mr. Khan in the game, as 12 of his MNAs have openly declared that they will vote against him in the no-confidence vote. A magic number of 172 is required in the 342-member National Assembly. With several MNAs coming out openly against the Prime Minister, the Opposition now has the numbers to dethrone Mr. Khan. The stance of some of PTI\u2019s allies should also be a matter of concern \u2014 most of them are known to swing to the Army\u2019s tune. An Islamabad-based political analyst believes that Shehbaz Sharif, the current leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, and president of the Pakistan Muslim Leage (PML-N), could be the new Prime Minister, with other groups like the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) becoming part of the government. The analyst was of the view that such a government could be of a temporary nature and would inevitably lead to fresh elections that are, in any case, due in 2023. The term of the current National Assembly ends in August 2023. The inability of the PML-N and the PPP to keep step with the Army\u2019s perceived needs and requirements led to the khakis propping up and placing Mr. Khan in the saddle after the 2018 general elections. It\u2019s a bit of a secret as to how the Army manages the elections in Pakistan, but the fact remains that they have often managed this feat. In the past, the Army has funnelled money to political groups of their choice. In the current scenario, they think that Mr. Shehbaz Sharif, brother of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, could be their best bet. A three-time Prime Minister, Mr. Nawaz Sharif is now living in political exile in London. He is a better critic of the Army and remembers his ouster twice at the hands of the military establishment \u2014 in 1993 and in 1999. In 2017, Mr. Sharif was removed as Prime Minister following a Supreme Court order. His brother, the junior Sharif, is more amenable to working with the Army. No elected government has ever been removed from office through a no-confidence vote \u2014 the Army and the Supreme Court have played this role. If Mr. Khan\u2019s government falls, this will be a first for Pakistan. The role of the Speaker and the mass mobilisation promised by the Prime Minister could play the role of spoiler in the conduct of the no-confidence motion. "

        "title": "\nSri Lanka\u2019s aggravating economic crisis\n",
        "text": "The story so far: Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis is aggravating rapidly, putting citizens through enormous hardship. Over the weekend, at least two senior citizens died while waiting in long queues to buy fuel; the price of cooking gas spiked to LKR 4,199 (roughly \u20b91,150), the price of the widely used milk powder shot up by LKR 600 a kg, and authorities were forced to cancel school examinations for millions of students, due to a shortage of paper. Sri Lanka is in the grips of one of its worst economic meltdowns in history. The first wave of the pandemic in 2020 offered early and sure signs of the distress \u2014 when thousands of Sri Lankan labourers in West Asian countries were left stranded and returned jobless; garment factories and tea estates in Sri Lanka could not function, as infections raged in clusters, and thousands of youth lost their jobs in cities as establishments abruptly sacked them or shut down. It meant that all key foreign exchange earning sectors, such as exports and remittances, along with tourism, were brutally hit. The lack of a comprehensive strategy to respond to the crisis then, coupled with certain policy decisions last year \u2014 including the government\u2019s abrupt switch to organic farming \u2014widely deemed \u201cill-advised\u201d, further aggravated the problem. In August last year, the government declared emergency regulations for the distribution of essential food items, amid wide import restrictions to save dollars which in turn led to consequent market irregularities, and reported hoarding. Fears of a sovereign default rose by the end of 2021, with the country\u2019s foreign reserves plummeting to $1.6 billion, and deadlines for repaying external loans looming. But Sri Lanka managed to keep its unblemished foreign debt servicing record. All the same, without enough dollars to import essentials such as food, fuel, and medicines, the year 2022 began on a rather challenging note, marked by further shortages and an economic upheaval. At the macro-economic level, all indicators are worrisome. The Sri Lankan rupee, that authorities floated this month, has fallen to nearly 265 against the U.S. dollar. Consumer Price inflation is at 16.8% and foreign reserves stood at $2.31 billion at the end of February. Sri Lanka must repay foreign debt totalling nearly $7 billion this year and continue importing essentials from its dwindling dollar account. In a recent address to the country, President Rajapaksa said Sri Lanka will incur an import bill of $22 billion this year, resulting in a trade deficit of $10 billion. For citizens, this means long waits in queues for fuel, a shortage of cooking gas, contending with prolonged power cuts in many localities and struggles to find medicines for patients. In families of working people, the crisis is translating to cutting down on milk for children, eating fewer meals, or going to bed hungry. Yes, both citizens and different segments of the political opposition are taking to the streets, demanding that President Rajapaksa go home. Many media houses are criticising the government, while social media pages are rife with memes and sharp commentary on the Rajapaksas. \u201cThis crisis was not created by me,\u201d President Rajapaksa has said, pointing to challenges that arose due to the pandemic. Despite many economists putting forward support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the \u201conly option\u201d for the government, the establishment was reluctant until recently when mounting protests and criticism forced the government into a policy U-turn. The government is now in talks with the IMF to \u201cto find a way to pay off our annual loan instalments, sovereign bonds\u201d, Mr. Rajapaksa said. It remains to be seen how the IMF will support Sri Lanka at this juncture, and to what extent its support might help the country cope with the crisis. Colombo has also sought support from various bilateral partners, including India, by way of loans, currency swaps, and credit lines for import of essentials. Beginning January 2022, India has extended assistance totalling $ 2.4 billion \u2014 including an $400 million RBI currency swap, a $500 million loan deferment, and credit lines for importing food, fuel, and medicines. Of this, a billion-dollar credit line was finalised last week, during Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa\u2019s visit to New Delhi. \u201cNeighbourhood first. India stands with Sri Lanka. $1 billion credit line signed for supply of essential commodities. Key element of the package of support extended by India,\u201d External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said in a tweet. Meanwhile, China is considering Sri Lanka's recent request for further $2.5 billion assistance, in addition to the $2.8 billion Beijing has extended since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Chinese Ambassador in Colombo told a media conference. The leadership has thanked India for the timely assistance, but there is growing scepticism in Sri Lankan media and some sections, over Indian assistance \u201cbeing tied\u201d to New Delhi inking key infrastructure projects in the island nation in the recent past \u2014 mainly the strategic Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm project; the National Thermal Power Corporation\u2019s recent agreement with Ceylon Electricity Board to set up a solar power plant in Sampur, in Sri Lanka\u2019s eastern Trincomalee district; and two renewable energy projects in northern Sri Lanka, with investment from India\u2019s Adani Group. The weekend newspaper Sunday Times took an editorial position that New Delhi was resorting to \u201cdiplomatic blackmail\u201d, while cartoonists have depicted Sri Lankan leaders trading crucial energy projects for emergency financial assistance from India. The political opposition has accused the Adani Group of entering Sri Lanka through the \u201cback door\u201d, avoiding competitive bids and due process. "

        "text": " Rescuers continued the search for survivors from Monday\u2019s crash of a China Eastern Airlines aircraft in the hills of southern China, while the airline, China\u2019s second-largest, grounded its entire Boeing 737-800 fleet.As of March 22 evening, authorities said no survivors had been found from what is China\u2019s biggest air tragedy in more than a decade.More than 2,000 personnel from search teams were combing through the mountainous crash site as the focus turned to locating the aircraft\u2019s black boxes and investigating the cause of the crash. Local authorities said both personnel and drones were being used to find the black boxes while the terrain in the mountains had posed logistical difficulties. The search site spanned 6,80,000 square metres, and drones will use thermal imaging to locate the black boxes.The plane, with 132 people on board including nine crew, crashed a little over an hour after taking off on March 21 afternoon from Kunming, bound for Guangzhou.Investigators will look to the black boxes to make sense of why the Boeing 737-800 suddenly dropped from cruising altitude. Flight tracking website FlightRadar24 said the plane was cruising at 29,100 feet before it suddenly and rapidly lost altitude, plunging 21,000 feet in a little over one minute and crashing into the hills near a village in southern Guangxi province. The last received data indicated a vertical speed of 31,000 feet per minute.China Eastern Airlines said it had grounded its entire Boeing 737-800 fleet, although China\u2019s two other major carriers, Air China and China Southern Airlines, did not do so. The 737-800 aircraft has had no known problems unlike the Boeing 737 Max, which Chinese regulators had grounded for more than two years after crashes of the new model in Indonesia and Ethiopia.The last major crash in China was that of a Henan Airlines Embraer in 2010. That aircraft crashed while on approach in foggy weather and 44 people were killed.The China Eastern crash is one of China\u2019s worst ever air tragedies. The death in 1994 of 160 people after the crash of a Tupolev aircraft remains China\u2019s biggest air disaster.Over the past two decades, China has overhauled its aviation sector and established a robust safety record, phasing out older planes such as the Tupolev and operating a relatively young fleet of mostly Airbus and Boeing planes."

Mr. Biden will travel to Brussels on Wednesday for summit level meetings with allies and partners at NATO, the G7 and the European Council. He will also have bilateral discussions with his Polish counterpart Andrej Duda in Warsaw on Saturday. Poland has seen a large inflow of Ukrainian refugees since the war began.India is among a small minority of countries that has not called out Moscow for its attack on Ukraine which began on February 24. The Biden administration had said, soon after the invasion began, that it hoped those countries with stronger ties to Moscow than the U.S. would leverage their relationship in a \u201cconstructive way\u201d, and New Delhi has repeatedly highlighted the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been on the phone with the leaders of Ukraine and Russia. However, weeks into the attack, pressure has mounted for India to take a stronger stand against Mr. Putin."

I think we need to see what would follow from that statement,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said.He said it was too early to say how the new development would ensure the recognition of the Rohingya refugees, who have long been denied citizenship in Myanmar, and the fundamental questions remained how and when they would go back to Myanmar.He also said that going for harsh economic sanction by the U.S. against Myanmar could be the next outcome. He said it was also equally important to see whether the U.S. would take interest in supporting the International Court of Justice in The Hague where Myanmar is facing a trial put forward by Gambia.Myanmar's government is already under multiple layers of U.S. sanctions since a military coup ousted the democratically elected government in February 2021. Thousands of civilians throughout the country have been killed and imprisoned as part of ongoing repression of anyone opposed to the ruling junta.Currently Bangladesh is hosting more than 1 million Rohingya refugees. More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled from Buddhist-majority Myanmar to refugee camps in Bangladesh since August 2017, when the military launched an operation aimed at clearing them from the country following attacks by a rebel group.Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said repeatedly that their repatriation to Myanmar is the solution to the crisis but Bangladesh would not force them to leave Bangladesh."

Mr. Griffin's lawyer said he doesn't plan to call any defence witnesses.The case against Mr. Griffin is unlike most of the Capitol riot prosecutions. He is one of the few riot defendants who isn't accused of entering the Capitol or engaging in any violent or destructive behaviour. He claims he has been selectively prosecuted for his political views.Mr. Griffin, one of three members of the Otero County Commission in southern New Mexico, is among a handful of riot defendants who either held public office or ran for a government leadership post in the 2 1/2 years before the attack.He is among only three riot defendants who have asked for a bench trial, which means a judge will decide his case without a jury.Mr. Griffin, a 48-year-old former rodeo rider and former pastor, helped found a political committee called Cowboys for Trump. He had vowed to arrive at the courthouse on horseback. Instead, he showed up Monday as a passenger in a pickup truck that had a horse trailer on the back.Mr. Griffin is charged with two misdemeanours: entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds."
